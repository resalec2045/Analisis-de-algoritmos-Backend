abstract = {We introduce SensorDCSP, a naturally distributed benchmark based on a real-world application that arises in the context of networked distributed systems. In order to study the performance of Distributed CSP (DisCSP) algorithms in a truly distributed setting, we use a discrete-event network simulator, which allows us to model the impact of different network traffic conditions on the performance of the algorithms. We consider two complete DisCSP algorithms: asynchronous backtracking (ABT) and asynchronous weak commitment search (AWC), and perform performance comparison for these algorithms on both satisfiable and unsatisfiable instances of SensorDCSP. We found that random delays (due to network traffic or in some cases actively introduced by the agents) combined with a dynamic decentralized restart strategy can improve the performance of DisCSP algorithms. In addition, we introduce GSensorDCSP, a plain-embedded version of SensorDCSP that is closely related to various real-life dynamic tracking systems. We perform both analytical and empirical study of this benchmark domain. In particular, this benchmark allows us to study the attractiveness of solution repairing for solving a sequence of DisCSPs that represent the dynamic tracking of a set of moving objects.}

abstract = {Collaborative Computer-Supported Argument Visualization (CCSAV) is a technical methodology that offers support for online collective deliberation over complex dilemmas. As compared with more traditional conversational technologies, like wikis and forums, CCSAV is designed to promote more critical thinking and evidence-based reasoning, by using representations that highlight conceptual relationships between contributions, and through computational analytics that assess the structural integrity of the network. However, to date, CCSAV tools have achieved adoption primarily in small-scale educational contexts, and only to a limited degree in real world applications. We hypothesise that by reifying conversations as logical maps to address the shortcomings of chronological streams, CCSAV tools underestimate the importance of participation and interaction in enhancing collaborative knowledge-building. We argue, therefore, that CCSAV platforms should be socially augmented in order to improve their mediation capability. Drawing on Clark and Brennan influential Common Ground theory, we designed a Debate Dashboard, which augmented a CCSAV tool with a set of widgets that deliver meta-information about participants and the interaction process. An empirical study simulating a moderately sized collective deliberation scenario provides evidence that this experimental version outperformed the control version on a range of indicators, including usability, mutual understanding, quality of perceived collaboration, and accuracy of individual decisions. No evidence was found that the addition of the Debate Dashboard impeded the quality of the argumentation or the richness of content.}

To inspire authors to explore diverse data collection strategies and methods beyond experiments and survey-based (replication) studies, this work presents four distinct but equally suitable research formats for RRs: meta-analyses, qualitative research, computational approaches, and field intervention studies. Expanding prior research that has explored and promoted general practices and methodological standards for RRs, we offer unique recommendations for preparing an adequate RR proposal along each of these four RR avenues. Additionally, we provide a table of summary resources for authors, reviewers, and editors looking to engage more with RR.

Although the implementation of such technologies has been previously studied, difficulties exist in maintaining balance between high rate of resource recovery and low environmental, economic, and social impacts, particularly in rural regions with limited resources. We developed a data-driven framework by integrating machine learning with life cycle thinking that can be used as an open-source tool to help overcome these barriers. The framework was applied to compare two emerging technologies: pyrolysis versus hydrothermal carbonization for managing the excess poultry litter in a rural agricultural region. Among different machine learning models, random forest regression was the most successful to predict resource recovery of both technologies. Next, sustainability analysis indicated that the environmental (global warming), economic (annual worth), and social (system intrusiveness) impacts of pyrolysis was lower than hydrothermal carbonization. Finally, the framework revealed that implementation of pyrolysis at 600 °C for 1 h with the heating rate of 20 °C/min would result in the highest rate of resource recovery that corresponded to the lowest impacts. These results can be helpful in providing operational conditions for implementing emerging resource recovery technologies in rural agricultural regions.}

Dependence on wood fuel characterises most Sub-Saharan countries and WES are complex socio-ecological systems dynamically linked to crucial development issues, e.g., deforestation and poverty. In Mozambique WES supply over 70% of the national energy needs through an informal business network worth around one million euros each year. In contrast with the 2MBio, currently available tools often aim at supporting decision-making on WES with off-the-shelf expert solutions and optimisation of WES efficiency, supply chains and resource management. While relevant and useful, such approaches are frequently unsuitable to engage the knowledge and creativity of a wide range of crucial actors. The 2MBio addresses this gap providing a simple, visual platform on paper that supports from illiterate to professional users, to stimulate creative ideas and apply current knowledge while designing their own WES. The results of implementation in real settings in South Mozambique produced relevant design breakthroughs. Compared with the absence of any other support tool, and faced with same design challenges, the 2MBio participatory design workshops in south Mozambique resulted in comprehensive analysis of wood fuel energy systems, and innovative integrated WES solutions design. The proposed approach raised participants’ awareness about opportunities and constrains linked to their WES while also facilitating information sharing new learning dynamics and enhance creativity.}

Chemistry and diffusion (of ions and gel) are not modelled. The focus is put on the mechanical consequences of the progressive replacement of the aggregates by a less dense gel. A ring-shaped crack then appears in the cement paste depending on the pressure build-up, according to an incremental energy criterion. The stored elastic energy and deformation of each configuration are determined assuming that each aggregate is embedded in an infinite cement paste matrix, through Finite Element Analysis. We note a very different behaviour of aggregates of different sizes. Adding the contributions of different aggregates leads to an estimate of the free expansion of a concrete of given aggregate size distribution. Parameters of the model are identified, providing a good fit to experiments taken from Multon's work.}

We apply a generalized version of reinforcement learning, popularly known as the experience-weighted attraction (EWA) learning model, which has a connection to specific cognitive constructs, such as memory decay, the depreciation of past experience, counterfactual thinking, and choice intensity. Through the estimates of the model, we examine behavioral differences among individuals due to different levels of WMC. In accordance with ‘Miller’s magic number’, which is the constraint of working memory capacity, we consider two different sizes (granularities) of strategy space: one is larger (finer) and one is smaller (coarser). We find that constraining the EWA models by using levels (granules) within the limits of working memory allows for a better characterization of the data based on individual differences in WMC. Using this level-reinforcement version of EWA learning, also referred to as the EWA rule learning model, we find that working memory capacity can significantly affect learning behavior. Our likelihood ratio test rejects the null that subjects with high WMC and subjects with low WMC follow the same EWA learning model. In addition, the parameter corresponding to ‘counterfactual thinking ability’ is found to be reduced when working memory capacity is low.}

abstract = {Background
Previous studies have demonstrated telemedicine (TM) to be an effective tool to complement rheumatology care and address workforce shortage. With the outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, TM experienced a massive upswing. However, in rheumatology care, the use of TM stagnated again shortly thereafter. Consequently, the factors associated with physicians’ willingness to use TM (TM willingness) and actual use of TM (TM use) need to be thoroughly investigated.
Objective
This study aimed to identify the factors that determine TM use and TM willingness among German general practitioners and rheumatologists.
Methods
We conducted a secondary analysis of data from a German nationwide cross-sectional survey with general practitioners and rheumatologists. Bayesian univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were applied to the data to determine which factors were associated with TM use and TM willingness. The predictor variables (covariates) that were studied individually included sociodemographic factors (eg, age and sex), work characteristics (eg, practice location and medical specialty), and self-assessed knowledge of TM. All the variables positively and negatively associated with TM use and TM willingness in the univariate analysis were then considered for Bayesian model averaging analysis after a selection based on the variance inflation factor (≤2.5). All analyses were stratified by sex.
Results
Univariate analysis revealed that out of 83 variables, 36 (43%) and 34 (41%) variables were positively or negatively associated (region of practical equivalence≤5%) with TM use and TM willingness, respectively. The Bayesian model averaging analysis allowed us to identify 13 and 17 factors of TM use and TM willingness, respectively. Among these factors, being female, having very poor knowledge of TM, treating <500 patients per quarter, and not being willing to use TM were negatively associated with TM use, whereas having good knowledge of TM and treating >1000 patients per quarter were positively associated with TM use. In addition, being aged 51 to 60 years, thinking that TM is not important for current and future work, and not currently using TM were negatively associated with TM willingness, whereas owning a smart device and working in an urban area were positively associated with TM willingness.
Conclusions
The results point to the close connection between health care professionals’ knowledge of TM and actual TM use. These results lend support to the integration of digital competencies into medical education as well as hands-on training for health care professionals. Incentive programs for physicians aged >50 years and practicing in rural areas could further encourage TM willingness.}

This kind of energy has enormous potential applications in fields of technology such as photovoltaic panels, renewable power, solar light poles, and solar pumps used for water extraction. The era in which we are living is all about the applications of solar energy in industrial sectors most importantly in solar sports car manufacturing. This article presents a new way of thinking about the heat transport analyses of photovoltaic hybrid vehicles, by factoring Casson-Sutterby liquid with the inclusion of various effects like variable thermal conduction, thermal radiation, heat generation, and tetrahybrid nanoparticles. To solve the modelled equations in regards to both momentum and energy, another well-computational approach known as the Cash and Carp method was used. The effects of a wide variety of factors on temperature, shear stress, and velocity fields, as well as the surface drag coefficient and Nusselt number, are briefly described and illustrated in the form of tables and figures. It then found that the thermal radiation, heat production, and thermal conductivity parameters and insertion of agglomerative tetrhybrid nanoparticles in the base fluid amplify heat transfer rate, it has been shown that the performance of the solar car increases in terms of heat transition. In comparison to standard nanofluid, tetrahybrid nanofluid is the most effective medium for the transmission of heat. From the regression analysis, it is observed that the error in terms of Nusselt number is smaller 0.0151 for the case ε=1.5, and increases to 0.0151 in the case of ε=2.5. Relative percentage error is smaller 4.62% in the case of heat generation Q=0.7 but a maximum of 15.8% in the case of thermal radiation Rd=2.}

There is no simple formula for its computation, thus numerical algorithms are essential for coping with the practical problems involved. The commercial implementations for the numerical solutions, such as the functions ellipticK and EllipticK provided by MATLAB and Mathematica respectively, are based on Kcs(m) instead of the usual form K(k) such that Kcs(k2)=K(k) and m=k2. It is necessary to develop open source implementations for the computation of the CEI-1 in order to avoid potential risks of using commercial software and possible limitations due to the unknown factors. In this paper, the infinite series method, arithmetic-geometric mean (AGM) method, Gauss–Chebyshev method and Gauss–Legendre methods are discussed in details with a top-down strategy. The four key algorithms for computing the CEI-1 are designed, verified, validated and tested, which can be utilized in R& D and be reused properly. Numerical results show that our open source implementations based on K(k) are equivalent to the commercial implementation based on Kcs(m). The general algorithms for computing orthogonal polynomials developed are valuable for the STEM education and scientific computation.}

The task is more challenging than criminal court view generation as the latter generates views based only on criminal facts as input, whereas the CCVG must consider both the plaintiff’s claims and civil facts under the principle of “no claim, no trial.” However, current approaches still follow criminal domain practices to solve problems in civil cases. Moreover, the explicit modeling of the potential correspondence between claims and facts has often been neglected, as court views are required to respond to each corresponding claim based on factual evidence. To address the issues, we propose a dual path interaction network augmented by two self-supervised auxiliary tasks (named DuaPIN), which follows a bionic design by simulating the thinking logic of judges when writing opinions. Specifically, we construct a structurally symmetric Transformer-based dual path multi-encoder–decoder model such that the two inputs, claim and fact, contribute equally to the generation of civil court views. Moreover, an auxiliary task enhanced (ATE) training paradigm using multiple DuaPIN decoders is proposed to explicitly model the potential correspondence between claims and facts. Extensive experiments on public legal document dataset demonstrated that DuaPIN achieves competitive performance compared with previous methods and offers certain performance improvements to popular pre-trained language models via the ATE training method.}

Despite abundant reports about the effectiveness of suggestions in altering behavior, perception, cognition, and agency, no consensus exists regarding the mechanisms driving these changes. This article reviews competing theoretical accounts that address the genesis of subjective, behavioral, and neurophysiological responses to hypnotic suggestions. We systematically analyze the broad landscape of hypnosis theories that best represent our estimation of the current status and future avenues of scientific thinking. We start with procedural descriptions of hypnosis, suggestions, and hypnotizability, followed by a comparative analysis of systematically selected theories. Considering that prominent theoretical perspectives emphasize different aspects of hypnosis, our review reveals that each perspective possesses salient strengths, limitations, and heuristic values. We highlight the necessity of revisiting extant theories and formulating novel evidence-based accounts of hypnosis.}

In this chapter, I am looking at artificial intelligence (AI) specifically in the context of creativity. My view is inevitably a personal one, as for the time being, the answers to the tough questions on AI entail working with beliefs more so than with facts, opinions more so than hard evidence. What matters most in “AI Creativity” is how we define creativity, as this definition will determine whether we can consider AI to be creative, now or in the future. It is also important to explore what kind of impact AI has or may have on human creativity.}

Precision is an important component of spatial data quality, and a key to appropriate integration of collections of data sets. Previous work of the author provides a theoretical foundation for imprecision of spatial data resulting from finite granularities, and gives the beginnings of an approach to reasoning with such data using methods similar to rough set theory. This paper develops the theory further, and extends the work to a model that includes both spatial and semantic components. Notions such as observation, schema, frame of discernment and vagueness are examined and formalised.}

We develop a clustering method that takes advantage of the sturdiness of model-based clustering, while attempting to mitigate this issue. The proposed approach allows each margin to have a varying number of clusters and employs a strategy game-inspired algorithm, named ‘Reign-and-Conquer’, to cluster the data. Since the proposed clustering approach only specifies a model for the margins, but leaves the joint unspecified, it has the advantage of being partially parallelizable; hence, the proposed approach is computationally appealing as well as more tractable for moderate to high dimensions than a ‘full’ (joint) model-based clustering approach. A battery of numerical experiments on simulated data indicates an overall good performance of the proposed methods in a variety of scenarios, and real datasets are used to showcase their usefulness in practice.}

Recent evidence has shown that reflection can enhance motivation for in-depth learning, improve cognitive and metacognitive strategies, and promote self-regulated learning. While some studies have reported the positive effects of reflective interventions on student academic outcomes, conflicting findings exist. To provide a comprehensive understanding of the effectiveness of reflective interventions on academic achievement, this meta-analysis synthesized data from 25 quantitative studies (comprising 29 effect sizes) conducted between 2012 and 2022, with a total of 2,111 participants. The results revealed a significant overall effect of reflective interventions on academic achievement (g = 0.793, p < 0.001). Further moderator analyses indicated that the effectiveness of reflective interventions was influenced by factors such as learning mode, intervention duration, the role of reflective writing, and culture. However, education level, discipline, teacher or expert feedback, peer interaction, and technological scaffolding did not significantly affect the impact of reflective interventions across studies. These findings highlight the importance of fostering reflective thinking and refining the detailed design of reflective interventions to enhance students’ academic achievement.}

The large scale fluid motions in the radial and axial directions that promote mixing are caused primarily by effects of platform geometry, but are augmented to some degree by the intrinsic tendency of a decelerating rotational flow to reverse direction within Ekman layers that form at the boundaries. Along with Part I of this work [Y. Zhou and J.J. Derby, J.

Factor analysis indicated the anticipated structure of the test with two major factors - critical thinking/verbal reasoning abilities and numerical/spatial/analytical abilities. Since the role of admission tests in the process of selection new university students is crucial, it is essential to periodically reassess its psychometric characteristics to ensure that our test remain relevant and applicable.}

abstract = {As a large number of renewable energy resources are connected to power systems, the operation, planning, and optimization of power systems have been becoming more and more complex. Power flow calculation, unit commitment, economic dispatch, energy pricing, and power system planning are essentially computation problems. A lot of computing resources are required for these problems, which are non-trivial, especially for large-scale power systems with the high penetration of renewable energy. Traditionally, the calculation and optimization of power systems are completed by classical computers based on the classical computing theory and the von Neumann architecture. However, with Moore’s law getting closer and closer to the limit, the importance of quantum computing has become increasingly prominent. Quantum computing has been applied to some fields to a certain extent, yet the applications of quantum computing in power systems are rare. As the power industry is the foundation of the national economy, introducing quantum computing into the power system has far-reaching and crucial significance, such as improving the penetration of renewable energy, enhancing the computing efficiency, and helping in achieving the goal of net zero and climate neutrality by 2050. This paper first introduces the core concepts, essential ideas and theories of quantum computing, and then reviews the existing literature on the applications of quantum computing in power systems, and puts forward our critical thinking about the applications of quantum computing in power systems. In brief, this paper is dedicated to a tutorial on quantum computing targeting power system professionals and a review of its applications in power systems. The main contributions of this paper are: (1) introduce quantum computing into the field of power engineering in a thoroughly detailed way and delineate the analysis methodologies of quantum circuits systematically without losing mathematical rigor; (2) based on Dirac’s notation, the related formulae are derived meticulously with sophisticated schematic diagrams; (3) elaborate and derive some critical quantum algorithms in depth, which play an important role in the applications of quantum computing in power systems; (4) critically summarize and comment on the existing literature on the applications of quantum computing in power systems; (5) the future applications and challenges of quantum computing in power systems are prospected and remarked.}

Addressing these gaps, in Experiments 1a (n = 31) and 1b (n = 30), we found that Chinese students demonstrate the NNB despite linguistic differences between Chinese and western languages. Experiment 2 (n = 38) adopted a negative priming paradigm and found that inhibitory control was necessary to overcome the NNB. Experiment 3 (n = 34) employed the event-related potential technique; we observed increased P2 amplitude when students solved congruent problems, and increased N2 and decreased P3 amplitude when they solved incongruent problems. These results indicated that the NNB is rooted in intuitive thinking, and overcoming this bias relies on inhibition.}

In particular, we analysed the logic that emanates from these novel digital interventions, how they operate on the complex urban built environment and the population, and their effects on urban and citizenry morphologies. Next, we examined a series of state-led technological implementations that have emerged since the Covid-19 pandemic, providing digital solutions that assist citizens with the changing rhythms of everyday living, data-capturing sensors and gantries to aid authorities in contract tracing efforts and enforce vaccination differentiation measures, geospatial digital mapping of demographic data, in withal robotics for automated policing and cleaning activities; and the use of AI and automated data-driven tools in public health to improve service delivery and care to patients. While we are unable to exhaust every piece of technology for the purpose of this paper, these developments, along with their design thinking and operations, we argue, are helpful in revealing the contemporary conjectures of Singaporean digital urban idealism and the governing strategies of the state.

First, moving from the literature on innovation ecosystems and industry platforms, using systems thinking framing, it explains the platformization of innovation ecosystems through the double lens structure-system. Second, it identifies the holographic strategy as one of the typical patterns featuring platform-based innovation ecosystem envelopment beyond extant market boundaries. These conceptualizations have insightful theoretical, managerial, and policy implications. In particular, the work discusses the ecosystem as a valid unit of analysis for understanding such an unprecedented shaped-by-platform landscape.

The Workshop concluded that good progress is being made to assess repeated dose toxicity without animals taking advantage of existing knowledge in toxicology, thresholds of toxicological concern, adverse outcome pathways and read-across workflows. These approaches can be supported by New Approach Methodologies (NAMs) utilising modern molecular technologies and computational methods. Recommendations from the Workshop were based around the needs for better chemical safety assessment: how to strengthen the evidence base for decision making; to develop, standardise and harmonise NAMs for human toxicity; and the improvement in the applicability and acceptance of novel techniques. “Disruptive thinking” is required to reconsider chemical legislation, validation of NAMs and the opportunities to move away from reliance on animal tests. Case study practices and data sharing, ensuring reproducibility of NAMs, were viewed as crucial to the improvement of non-animal test approaches for systemic toxicity.}

There are many technological alternatives for each sub-category of complex sustainable energy systems. Life cycle assessment (LCA) can be an effective tool to compare the environmental impacts of each pathway and identify the most promising alternatives from an environmental impact perspective. This contribution first reviews the environmental assessment methods and tools developed over the years. Secondly, a comprehensive review of the contribution of the PSE community to the environmental impact analysis of renewable energy systems is performed. It is observed that while LCA is the preferred method, these studies differed widely concerning the choice of impact assessment method used, the level of details shared concerning the underlying LCA calculations, and whether or not sensitivity and uncertainty analyses were carried out, among many others. This makes the comparison of results from different studies difficult and often impossible. It is clear that the PSE community, with its emphasis on systems thinking and holistic approaches, plays a critical role in the design, integration, and operation of complex sustainable energy systems. However, the thorough calculations necessary to ensure a robust and transparent LCA analysis require a shared methodology and a detailed description of the rules. Such explicit, systematic, and transparent methods will set the bar for a minimum requirement for thorough LCA calculations, ensuring fair comparison and discussions of different technical solutions developed in the wider PSE community for sustainable renewables.}

abstract = {Due to the inherent shortcomings of traditional depth models, the Transformer model based on the self-attention mechanism has become popular in the field of fault diagnosis. The current Transformer's self-attentive mechanism provides an alternative way of thinking, which can make direct association between each signal. However, it can only focus on the association information within a sequence, and it is difficult to understand the information gap between samples. Therefore, this paper proposes the two-branch Twins attention, which for the first time uses cross-attention to focus on information associations between samples. Twins attention uses cross-attention to learn information associations between samples in addition to retaining the information associations within sequences learned by self-attention. The performance of the proposed model was validated on four popular bearing datasets. Compared to the original transformer structure, the average accuracy of each dataset improved by 1.73% to 99.42%, leading the noise experiments.}

Analysis suggests that Archer’s ambition for a rigorous ‘science of design’ inspired by linear algorithmic approaches was increasingly threatened with disruption by his experience of large, complex design projects. Reflecting on Archer's engagement with other models of designing, the article ends with Archer’s retrospective view and an account of his significantly altered opinions.

Brain Informatics is a rapidly expanding interdisciplinary field to systematically utilize brain-related data, information and knowledge coming from the entire research process for in-depth brain investigation. In the past few years, a data-centric conceptual brain model, namely Data-Brain, has been proposed, providing the foundation for the systematic Brain Informatics methodology. The Data-Brain model constitutes a conceptual framework and detailed guideline for managing and analyzing brain big data. The development of Data-Brain model also demands the support from advanced technologies. This paper presents an extensible version of the Data-Brain with advanced computing techniques in the connected world. It provides a global understanding of how multidisciplinary techniques work together to tackle brain computing challenges. Particularly, the integrated K-I-D (Knowledge-Information-Data) loop is proposed, constructing a cycle as the thinking space to help pursue the systematic brain investigation, by which the extensible Data-Brain model continuously iterates and evolves through the never-ending learning. Such synergistic evolvement will power future progress for building intelligence systems and applications connected with the study of complex human brain.}

The cognitive models are created by people, experts from different subjects’ fields. The modelling processes take a great deal of time. Furthermore, the result of the modelling has to be verified when the model’s creators cannot get complete information and have to understand the problem very quickly. The factors and their mutual relationships in cognitive models could be verified with Big Data analysis technology. But this approach takes into account only denotational semantics that are based on the mapping of the model on formalised logical constructions, words, objects, schemes. This paper addresses the issue of creating cognitive semantics that take into consideration thinking, feeling and transcendental factors. It is shown that the classical computer or quantum computer cannot ensure cognitive semantics because they are based on discrete representation of data. An optical computing and Optical Semantic approach could be applied. The architecture of the special optical processor is represented.}

The use of System Dynamics (SD) in modelling and analyzing local energy transitions is especially suitable given the characteristics of SD. Our aim is to systematically categorize the different ways SD is used and useful to scrutinize local energy transitions, and to see if we can discern any common themes that can be useful to researchers looking to scrutinize local energy transitions, using SD. The study is exploratory in nature, with peer-reviewed journal and conference articles analyzed using content analysis. The six categories on which the articles are analyzed are: the sector the article studies; the transition that is studied in the article; the modelling depth in the article; the objective of the article; the justification for using SD provided in the article and the levels of interaction with ‘local’. Our findings show most of the local energy transitions have been studied using simulatable Stock and Flow Diagrams in SD methodology. The important sectors in the energy field are represented in terms of SD modelling of local energy transitions, including electricity, transport, district heating etc. Most of the local energy transitions scrutinized by SD in the articles have descriptive objectives, with some prescriptive, and just one evaluative objective. In terms of justification for using SD provided by the articles analyzed in this study, we found four major themes along which the justifications that were provided. They are dynamics, feedbacks, delays and complexity, systematic thinking, bridging disciplines and actor interactions and behaviour. The ‘dynamics, feedbacks, delays and complexity’ theme is the most cited justification for the use of SD in scrutinizing local energy transitions, followed by systematic thinking.}

abstract = {In sound computation, computational processes are brought into the acoustic domain by a set of formalized instructions for controlling parameters in synthesis engines and compositional algorithms. From the acoustic events, listeners often extract patterns or “musical objects” in their perception to the extent that certain associations are made external to the computational process. Perceived, musical objects rapidly become immutable, and that immutability may be considered a compositional problem. The problem is how to approach a compositional project for bringing new insights into play while, on one side, using the existing representational system such as symbolic language in computation, and on the other side, facing listeners' perceptual tendency to make external associations. For composers, the problem requires technical solutions as well as an ability to articulate the philosophical issues. This problem also exists in semiotics, a general study of signs, when one has to borrow language from existing linguistic systems in order to express a new thought without being trapped within the immutability of given linguistic sources. Semiotic practice is a discipline which emphasizes the function of semiotics to generate necessary discourse to examine the linguistic system in use and its logocentric tendency—the tendency towards known signs. We define semiotic practice as a signifying process in which meaning may be generated during that particular process under study; thus, meaning in semiotic practice is temporal context-dependent as a function of signifiers. The compositional problems involving sound computation for generating cases to support semiotic practice inquires about two tasks: 1.(1) how to design software which enables acoustic events to be observed as processes rather than observing sounds only as familiar objects or transformations featuring the recognition of objects, and2.(2) how to compose a piece of music so mutability of signs can be observed. To meet these problems, this paper examines perspectives on systems and cognition from multiple views such as semiotics, computation theories, and synergetics. We also discuss software designed for composition in terms of semiotic practice.}

In most areas in decision making, integrating the related literature yields an exuberance of criteria which leads a robust decision. Yet, an excess number of criteria may handicap decision making or evaluations in terms of computational time and complexity. In these circumstances, decreasing the number of factors in exchange for a negligible amount of knowledge can emancipate the decision maker yet does not affect the quality of the decision. This elimination can be conducted through qualitative methods such as interviews or quantitative methods. However, quantitative methods are more trustworthy since qualitative methods can be deceptive due to the perceptions of the interviewee. Furthermore, working with larger groups is more prone to neutrality in terms of group thinking. On the subject of innovative power and risks, the literature offers 48 criteria depending on the industry, size or demographics of related companies. Prioritizing and working with these criteria for their decision making applications becomes computationally expensive, especially when embedded in more complex algorithms. In this study, 48 criteria will be reduced using Fuzzy Cognitive Maps and it is believed to provide a sufficient number of criteria with a negligible loss of information and comparisons will be conducted.}

It is shown that the discretization of the governing equations on a regular mesh is well adapted to data parallelism. For a typical test problem of supersonic flow through a ramped duct, computational speeds have been achieved using these massively-parallel computers that are superior to those obtained using a single processor of a Cray Y-MP.

Under an absolute code, the neural response used to represent the value of a given stimulus does not depend on what other values might have been encountered. By contrast, under a normalized code, the neural response associated with a given value depends on its relative position in the distribution of values. This review provides a simple framework for thinking about value normalization, and uses it to evaluate the existing experimental evidence.}

abstract = {Background and objectives
Depressed people hold positive beliefs about negative cognition (e.g., rumination is useful to find a solution), which may motivate those individuals to engage in sustained negative thinking. However, in reality, rumination often leads to unfavorable outcomes. Thus, such beliefs create a large discrepancy between one's expectations and the actual outcome. Therefore, we hypothesized that this prediction error would be associated with increased depressed mood.
Methods
We observed how people update their positive beliefs about negative cognition within a volatile environment, in which negative cognition does not always result in a beneficial outcome. Forty-six participants were offered two response options (retrieving a negative or positive personal memory) and subsequently provided either an economic reward or punishment. Retrieving a negative (rather than positive) memory was initially reinforced, although this action-outcome contingency was reversed during the task. In the control condition, positive memory retrieval was initially reinforced, although a contingency reversal was employed to encourage negative memory retrieval.
Results
Model-based computational modeling revealed that participants who showed a delay in switching from negative to positive (but not from positive to negative) responses experienced increased levels of depressed mood. This delay in switching was also found to be associated with depressive symptoms and trait rumination.
Limitations
The non-clinical nature of the sample may limit the clinical implications of the results.
Conclusions
Difficulty in updating positive beliefs (or outcome predictions) for negative cognition may play an important role in depressive symptomatology.}

We try to go beyond dichotomy, putting creativity in motion and outlining its embodied and enactive features. Based on the assumption that no creative act is purely conscious or purely unconscious, our discussion on creativity relies on the distinction of three types of creativity that complementarily contribute to the creative process through shifts in the activation of their substrates in the brain: the deliberate, spontaneous and flow types of creativity. The latter is a hybrid and embodied type, in which movement and physical activity meet creativity. We then focus on the most fascinating contribution of unconscious processes and mind wandering to spontaneous and flow modes of creativity, exploring what happens when the individual apparently takes a break from a deliberate and effortful search for solutions and the creative process progresses through an incubation phase. This phase and the overall creative process can be facilitated by physical activity which, depending on its features and context, can disengage the cognitive control network and free the mind from filters that constrain cognitive processes or, conversely, can engage attentional control on sensorimotor and cognitive task components in a mindful way. Lastly, we focus on the unique features of the outer natural environment of physical activity and of the inner environment during mindful movements that can restore capacities and boost creativity.}

We can distinguish several levels at which information is processed in the brain. The first one is the level of serial molecular genetic processes, similar in some aspects to digital computations (DC). At the same time, higher cognitive activity is probably based on parallel neural network computations (NNC). The advantage of neural networks is their intrinsic ability to learn, adapting their parameters to specific tasks and to external data. However, there seems to be a third level of information processing as well, which involves subjective consciousness and its units, so called qualia. They are difficult to study experimentally, and the very fact of their existence is hard to explain within the framework of modern physical theory. Here I propose a way to consider consciousness as the extension of basic physical laws – namely, total entropy dissipation leading to a system simplification. At the level of subjective consciousness, the brain seems to convert information embodied by neural activity to a more simple and compact form, internally observed as qualia. Whereas physical implementations of both DC and NNC are essentially approximate and probabilistic, qualia-associated computations (QAC) make the brain capable of recognizing general laws and relationships. While elaborating a behavioral program, the conscious brain does not act blindly or gropingly but according to the very meaning of such general laws, which gives it an advantage compared to any artificial intelligence system.}

This time complexity results in very long processing times for computing best paths in large networks, which can be a serious problem for real-time applications. Alternative approaches that give a better time complexity have been suggested, most of which are heuristics. However, these heuristics do not guarantee best solutions. To achieve best solutions at low computational costs, a parallel algorithm for parallel machines is suggested.
L’établissement de parcours s’emploie fréquemment dans l’analyse de réseau. De tous les algorithmes d’établissement de parcours disponibles, l’algorithme de Dijkstra est parmi ceux qu’on emploie le plus souvent afin de calculer les meilleurs itinéraires de réseaux. Cet algorithme assure les meilleures solutions avec une complexité temporelle de 0(N2) dans la pire éventualité. Cette complexité temporelle entraîne des temps de traitement très longs lors du calcul des meilleurs itinéraires dans les grands réseaux, ce qui peut constituer un problème sérieux pour les applications en temps réel. On a suggéré d’autres méthodes qui offrent une meilleure complexité temporelle, la plupart étant des heuristiques. Toutefois, ces heuristiques ne garantissent pas les meilleures solutions. Afin d’en arriver aux meilleurs solutions tout en réduisant les coûts de calcul, on suggère un algorithme parallèle pour des machines parallèles.}

This chapter presents examples that illustrate a type of programming project increasingly prominent in the field of knowledge engineering. The examples are chosen on grounds of familiarity, without any claim to represent the field of heuristic programming at large. The chapter begins by describing some software projects in computational heuristics. These projects are presented as case studies of the interaction between software engineering and knowledge engineering that illustrate the decisive importance of a powerful software environment. The chapter presents the case of the smart game board and describes the main software tool for rapid prototyping of game implementations, needed to conduct experiments. It also describes a project involving heuristics and knowledge engineering that has been evolving without interruption for the past five years. It presents paradigms of software development favored by system designers and implementers of exploratory development projects, and explains why these are often diametrically opposed to the conventional software engineering lore.}

A total of 1452 volunteers from the general population with no previous psychiatric history participated. They responded to clinical psychopathology assessment tests. Respondents solved a fake news screening test, which allowed them to be allocated to a quasi-experimental condition: group 1 (non-fake news consumers) or group 2 (fake news consumers). Mean comparison, Bayesian inference, and multiple regression analyses were applied. Participants with a schizotypal, paranoid, and histrionic personality were ineffective at detecting fake news. They were also more vulnerable to suffer its negative effects. Specifically, they displayed higher levels of anxiety and committed more cognitive biases based on suggestibility and the Barnum Effect. No significant effects on psychotic symptomatology or affective mood states were observed. Corresponding to these outcomes, two clinical and therapeutic recommendations related to the reduction of the Barnum Effect and the reinterpretation of digital media sensationalism were made. The impact of fake news and possible ways of prevention are discussed.}

The vision and objectives how DT should be realized on state level is portrayed in well-crafted DT policies. Yet, little is known how governments, as strategic actors, see their role in the DT and how they frame these documents. In this paper, we argue that policymaking about DT is isomorphic in the global context, rather than a differentiator for countries to gain a competitive edge. Using machine learning to analyze a vast text corpus of policy documents, we identify the common repertoire of narratives used by governments from all around the globe to picture their vision of the DT and show that DT policies appear to be almost context-free due to their high similarity.}

abstract = {In the past 15 years the framework and ideas from dynamical systems theory have been applied to a variety of transport and mixing problems in oceanic flows. The motivation for this approach comes directly from advances in observational capabilities in oceanography (e.g., drifter deployments, remote sensing capabilities, satellite imagery, etc.) which reveal space–time structures that are highly suggestive of the structures one visualizes in the global, geometrical study of dynamical systems theory. In this tutorial, we motivate this approach by showing the relationship between fluid transport in two-dimensional time-periodic incompressible flows and the geometrical structures that exist for two-dimensional area-preserving maps, such as hyperbolic periodic orbits, their stable and unstable manifolds and KAM (Kolmogorov–Arnold–Moser) tori. This serves to set the stage for the attempt to “transfer” this approach to more realistic flows modelling the ocean. However, in order to accomplish this several difficulties must be overcome. The first difficulty that confronts us that any attempt to carry out a dynamical systems approach to transport requires us to obtain the appropriate “dynamical system”, which is the velocity field describing the fluid flow. In general, adequate model velocity fields are obtained by numerical solution of appropriate partial differential equations describing the dynamical evolution of the velocity field. Numerical solution of the partial differential equations can only be done for a finite time interval, and since the ocean is generally not time-periodic, this leads to a new type of dynamical system: a finite-time, aperiodically time-dependent velocity field defined as a data set on a space–time grid. The global, geometrical analysis of transport in such dynamical systems requires both new concepts and new analytical and computational tools, as well as the necessity to discard some of the standard ideas and results from dynamical systems theory. The purpose of this tutorial is to describe these new concepts and analytical tools first using simple dynamical systems where quantities can be computed exactly. We then discuss their computational implications and implementation in the context of a model geophysical flow: a turbulent wind-driven double-gyre in the quasigeostrophic approximation.}

Bioinspired composite materials offer several advantages by mimicking the structure of natural counterparts. However, their complex hierarchical structure, compared to the limited number of observations, makes it difficult to extract all the structural features and vary the structure to optimize the materials’ functions without losing their natural features. We applied generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) to design composites inspired by animal skin patterns, leveraging a small dataset to generate diverse configurations that closely emulate natural designs. Our computational simulations investigated the structure-mechanics relationship in these materials, revealing significant variations in mechanical functions and identifying patterns that exhibited superior mechanical properties. We validated these outstanding configurations’ performance through tensile tests on specimens produced by a multimaterial printer. We showcase GenAI’s role in structural augmentation that can yield rational bioinspired designs, complemented by an educational web page with interactive games for public access.}

Useable response rates in these studies are almost always below 30% of the distributions of the surveys. While these studies are sometimes worthwhile for learning how respondents assess concepts and relationships among concepts, Rong and Wilkinson’s perspective on the severe limits to the value of such studies rings true: such surveys reveal more about executives’ sensemaking processes than the actual processes. The limitations of using one-shot, one-person-per-firm, self-reports as valid indicators of causal relationships of actual processes are so severe that academics should do more than think twice before using such surveys as the main method for collecting data – if scholars seek to understand and describe actual processes additional methods are necessary for data collection. The relevant literature includes several gems of exceptionally high quality, validity, and usefulness in the study of actual processes; identifying these studies is a useful step toward reducing the reliance on one-shot self-report surveys.}

Among other things, solving the equivalent dual ridge problem is computationally very fast even in high dimensions, and the crucial ‘amount of time variation’ is tuned by cross-validation. Evolving volatility is dealt with using a two-step ridge regression. I consider extensions that incorporate sparsity (the algorithm selects which parameters vary and which do not) and reduced-rank restrictions (variation is tied to a factor model). To demonstrate the usefulness of the approach, I use it to study the evolution of monetary policy in Canada using large time-varying local projections and TVP-VARs with demanding lag lengths. The applications require the estimation of up to 4600 TVPs, a task within the reach of the new method.}

On the other hand, computational neural network paradigms have evolved in the process of understanding the incredible learning and adaptive features of neuronal mechanisms inherent in certain biological species.

Through transcription regulation, LOGIC genes connect into a complex circuit, such as a XOR logic gate or a two-input flip–flop logic circuit capable of retaining information. LOGIC gene duplication, mutation and recombination may result in the diversification of Boolean logic gates. Creative thinking may sometimes require counter-intuitive reasoning, rather than common sense. Such reasoning is likely to engage novel logic circuits produced by LOGIC somatic mutations. An individual's logic maturates by a mechanism of somatic hypermutation, gene conversion and recombination of LOGIC genes in precursor cells followed by selection of neurons in the brain for functional competence. In this model, a single neuron among billions in the brain may contain a unique logic circuit being the key to a hard intellectual problem. The output of a logic neuron is likely to be a neurotransmitter. This neuron is connected to other neurons in the spiking neural network. The LOGIC gene hypothesis is testable by molecular techniques. Understanding mechanisms of authentic human ingenuity may help to invent digital systems capable of creative thinking.}

A large part of the risk management task involves anticipating, explaining and reacting to this response. One of the main approaches we have for analysing the emergent public response, the social amplification of risk framework, has been the subject of little modelling. The purpose of this paper is to explore how social risk amplification can be represented and simulated. The importance of heterogeneity among risk perceivers, and the role of their social networks in shaping risk perceptions, makes it natural to take an agent-based approach. We look in particular at how to model some central aspects of many risk events: the way actors come to observe other actors more than external events in forming their risk perceptions; the way in which behaviour both follows risk perception and shapes it; and the way risk communications are fashioned in the light of responses to previous communications. We show how such aspects can be represented by availability cascades, but also how this creates further problems of how to represent the contrasting effects of informational and reputational elements, and the differentiation of private and public risk beliefs. Simulation of the resulting model shows how certain qualitative aspects of risk response time series found empirically – such as endogenously-produced peaks in risk concern – can be explained by this model.}

Multiple sensors cooperate with each other to form a sensor cloud, which in turn extends the performance of a single sensor. The research on the data obtained by the star sensor has very important research and application values. First, a star point extraction model is proposed based on the fuzzy set model by analyzing the star image composition, which can reduce the amount of data computation. Then, a mapping model between content and space is constructed to achieve low-rank image representation and efficient computation. Finally, the data collected by the wireless sensor is delivered to the edge server, and a different method is used to achieve privacy protection. Only a small amount of core data is stored in edge servers and local servers, and other data is transmitted to the cloud. Experiments show that the proposed algorithm can effectively reduce the cost of communication and storage, and has strong privacy.}

Given the lack of tools for providing personalized feedback, this represents a significant challenge. The aim of this study is to see how best to support lecturers in giving timely feedback to students in a large class during problem-based learning. To meet this goal, we propose a model that combines feedforward, scaffolded using an automated summarization tool, with peer feedback. In this sense, the lecturer first provides feedforward through a series of general comments before an anonymous peer gives personalized feedback. The results show that, despite not giving personalized feedback, the lecturer is able to provide enriched formative feedforward thanks to the summary generated by the automated system. Furthermore, in more qualitative terms, the students show that they appreciate the opportunity to both give and receive feedback. Finally, the students' critical thinking skills are also shown to improve progressively from one activity to the next. Given the research gap regarding how lecturers use the reports generated by automated summarization tools, our study contributes to the literature by proposing a strategy for lecturers to use such reports to provide feedforward. Additionally, this study also contributes to the literature by proposing a model that can be fully integrated in both synchronous and asynchronous online learning.}

Then, the three evolutionary rules for cellular within a single cycle are analyzed separately for form and ordering. The best expressions for the cellular jealous neighbor rule and the solitary regeneration rule are given, and the most appropriate order in which the rules are run is selected. Finally, the solution results of the cellular gradient algorithm and other classical optimization design algorithms are compared with a multi-objective multi-parameter mechanical optimization design problem as an example. The computational results show that the cellular gradient algorithm has an advantage over other algorithms in solving global and dynamic mechanical optimal design problems. The novelty of CG is to provide a new way of thinking for solving optimization problems with global discontinuities.}

Uniquely human cognitive faculties arise from flexible interplay between specific local neural modules, with hemispheric asymmetries in functional specialization. Here, we discuss how these computational design principles provide a scaffold that enables some of the most advanced cognitive operations, such as semantic understanding of world structure, logical reasoning, and communication via language. We draw parallels to dual-processing theories of cognition by placing a focus on Kahneman’s System 1 and System 2. We propose integration of these ideas with the global workspace theory to explain dynamic relay of information products between both systems. Deepening the current understanding of how neurocognitive asymmetry makes humans special can ignite the next wave of neuroscience-inspired artificial intelligence.}

Such characteristic is widely captured in a plenitude of attribute reduction procedures, while igniting a tricky issue of tuning parameters. In this study, we therefore propose a parameter-free multi-granularity attribute reduction scheme. Fundamentally, our scheme applies three-way decision as thinking in threes. First, data-aware multi-granularity structure is automatically induced from self-contained distance space instead of manually edited or appointed granularities. Second, a novel multi-granularity feature evaluation criterion named hierarchical neighborhood entropy is defined to measure the feature significance. Finally, a sequential forward searching algorithm is designed to find the optimal reduct. With application to gene prioritization, our method performed on microarray data is experimentally demonstrated to be more effective and efficient in differentially expressed genes discovery as compared with other well-established attribute reduction algorithms.}

From the moment of conception, a process of neurodevelopment and complexification begins, generating and supporting a neuroelectric field that can be quantified by computational methods from dynamical systems theory. In the early embryo, genetically driven cellular processes are mediated by endogenous electromagnetic fields and intrinsic electrical fields produced by migrating neurons. In the ambient cellular environment, these interactions influence each other, impacting neural migration. The emergence of Theory of Mind, often considered a hallmark of conscious awareness, is accompanied by increasing neural connectivity, neuroelectric field complexity, and more integrated information processing. Neurodegeneration in old age and the often-associated decline in conscious awareness correlate closely with changes in the dynamical complexity of the neuroelectric field. Monitoring trajectories of the neuroelectric field and its complexity changes through the lifespan presents a developmental perspective and empirical correlation for studying the emergence and decline of human consciousness.}

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis following PRISMA guidelines. We searched keywords on Web of Science™ and Scopus®, and included peer-reviewed articles which quantitatively examined correlations between personality and climate attitudes. After screening, 74 papers were included in our review. From these articles, k = 100 samples were extracted and included in meta-analysis models. Our results show that Climate Change Denial is positively correlated with Social Dominance Orientation (r = 0.39) and Right-Wing Authoritarianism (r = 0.42), and negatively with Openness (r = −0.14), Conscientiousness (r = −0.05), Agreeableness (r = −0.11), Consideration of Future Consequences (r = −0.38), and Actively Open-Minded Thinking (r = −0.38).

However, since the three-way decision models now proposed are all based on a single decision criterion, the decision results typically reflect only one preference of decision-makers. Thus, these models may also not effectively deal with complex decision-making problems. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes a new three-way decision model based on ensemble learning. Specifically, we first obtain different three-way decision results by employing different decision criteria. Then, we can acquire the core and candidate sets of the positive and negative regions through set operations. Next, we use the K-means algorithm to divide the candidate sets into three disjoint subsets based on similarities. After that, we adopt a hierarchical filtering method to select suitable objects from the candidate sets and add them to the core sets. Finally, we employ four three-way decision models with different decision criteria as examples to conduct experiments on eight datasets. Experimental results show that our proposed model can obtain higher classification accuracy and lower deferment rate than other traditional three-way decision models under most experimental conditions.}

Background: Little is known about how cognitive domains other than episodic memory are affected during the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We attempted to clarify this issue in this study. Methods: Fifty-seven Japanese subjects were divided into two groups: one comprising people in the MCI stage of AD (MCI group, n = 28) and the other of normal controls (NC group, n = 29). Cognitive functions were assessed using the Japanese version of the neurobehavioral cognitive status examination (J-COGNISTAT). Results: The MCI group performed significantly worse than the NC group on subtests that assessed orientation, confrontational naming, constructive ability, episodic memory, and abstract thinking. Three-quarters of the MCI group had deficits in memory and other non-mnemonic domains, particularly constructive ability and abstract thinking. However, within-subject comparisons showed that the MCI group performed significantly worse on the memory subtest compared to any other subtest. Conclusions: Besides episodic memory, multiple non-mnemonic cognitive domains, such as constructive ability and abstract thinking, are also impaired during the MCI stage of AD; however, these non-mnemonic deficits are smaller than episodic memory impairment.}

Recent advances in structural and computational biology provide a unique opportunity to re-examine biologically relevant molecular structures and develop possible mechanistic insights for the large dynamic TFIIH complex. TFIIH presents many puzzles involving how its two SF2 helicase family enzymes, XPB and XPD, function in transcription initiation and repair: how do they initiate transcription, detect and verify DNA damage, select the damaged strand for incision, coordinate repair with transcription and cell cycle through Cdk-activating-kinase (CAK) signaling, and result in very different specific human diseases associated with cancer, aging, and development from single missense mutations? By joining analyses of breakthrough cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures and advanced computation with data from biochemistry and human genetics, we develop unified concepts and molecular level understanding for TFIIH functions with a focus on structural mechanisms. We provocatively consider that TFIIH may have first evolved from evolutionary pressure for TCR to resolve arrested transcription blocks to DNA replication and later added its key roles in transcription initiation and global DNA repair. We anticipate that this level of mechanistic information will have significant impact on thinking about TFIIH, laying a robust foundation suitable to develop new paradigms for DNA transcription initiation and repair along with insights into disease prevention, susceptibility, diagnosis and interventions.}

Traditional urban design methods focus on the form-making process and lack performance dimensions. Geodesign is an emerging approach that emphasizes the links between systems thinking, digital technology, and geographic context. This paper presents the research results of the first phase of a larger research collaboration and proposes an extended geodesign method for a district-scale urban design to integrate systems of renewable energy production, energy consumption, and storm water management, as well as a measurement of human experiences in cities. The method incorporates geographic information system (GIS), parametric modeling techniques, and multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) tools that enable collaborative design decision-making. The method is tested and refined in a test case with the objective of designing a near-zero-energy urban district. Our final method has three characteristics. ① Integrated geodesign and parametric design: It uses a parametric design approach to generate focal-scale district prototypes by means of a custom procedural algorithm, and applies geodesign to evaluate the performances of design proposals. ② A focus on design flow: It elaborates how to define problems, what information is selected, and what criteria are used in making design decisions. ③ Multi-objective optimization: The test case produces indicators from performance modeling and derives principles through a multi-objective computational experiment to inform how the design can be improved. This paper concludes with issues and next steps in modeling urban design and infrastructure systems based on MDO tools.}

As cognitive neuroscience is making more serious contact with the knowledge base of creativity, we must, from the outset, clear the ground of these pernicious fossil traces from a bygone era. The best neuroimaging techniques help little if we don’t know what to look for. Second, as an antidote to these theoretical duds, the article offers fresh ideas on possible mechanisms of creativity. Given that they are grounded in current understanding of cognitive and neural processes, it is hoped that these ideas represent steps broadly pointing in the right direction. In the end, the fundamental question we must ask ourselves is what, exactly, are the mental processes—or their critical elements—that yield creative thoughts.}

A central principle in neuroscience is that neurons within the brain act in concert to produce perception, cognition, and adaptive behavior. Neurons are organized into specialized brain areas, dedicated to different functions to varying extents, and their function relies on distributed circuits to continuously encode relevant environmental and body-state features, enabling other areas to decode (interpret) these representations for computing meaningful decisions and executing precise movements. Thus, the distributed brain can be thought of as a series of computations that act to encode and decode information. In this perspective, we detail important concepts of neural encoding and decoding and highlight the mathematical tools used to measure them, including deep learning methods. We provide case studies where decoding concepts enable foundational and translational science in motor, visual, and language processing.}

The tools let us integrate field data related to position and velocity in computing best-fit models with many degrees of freedom. As an application, we reanalyze a published study to demonstrate the extent to which kinematic vorticity is sensitive to modeling assumptions. The tools also open the door to an increased role for the mathematics of Lie groups (spaces of deformations) in structural geology. We suggest two topics for further study: numerical methods for non-steady deformations, and statistics of deformation tensors.}

Uncertain processing times are described by a large set of discrete scenarios, which is a type of big data. The objective is to minimize the schedule performance under the worst-case scenario. Identifying the worst-case scenario for each evaluated schedule is quite time-consuming in the situation that the scenario set size is large so that the objective evaluation might be computationally expensive. To handle this difficulty, three-way decision is used to preprocess the large-size scenario set to get a reduced scenario set so that the concept of surrogate worst-case scenario is adopted. A hybrid harmony search algorithm of combining three-island framework and the scenario-based local search is developed to solve the discussed problem. Based on the single-scenario knowledge of 2PFSP, a problem-specific scenario-dependent neighborhood structure is constructed under the surrogate worst-case scenario. An extensive experiment was carried out. The computational results show that the application of surrogate worst-case scenario based on three-way decision is effective in reducing the time consuming while keeping schedule performance evaluation. Being compared to the worst-case scenario objective evaluation, for an example in the case of the middle bad-scenario ratio, the surrogate worst-case scenario objective evaluation made the solution algorithm save 12.95 % in average CPU time for all instances while the relative performance difference is only 1.809 % in average. Being compared to possible alternative algorithms derived from the state-of-the-art algorithms, the developed algorithm is advantageous for the addressed problems.}

We found that the coding scheme could be applied reliably, and that factual questions were predominant (as in previous research). We explore differences in the lecturers’ use of questions – both between our UK sample and the previous US work, and between individual lecturers in our sample. We note the presence of strings of related successive questions from the lecturer, which we term ‘question chains’. We explore the nature of these, examine their prevalence, and seek to account for them in terms of the lecturers’ possible intentions.}

abstract = {The development of product design specifications (PDS) is an important part of the product development process. Incompleteness, ambiguity, or inconsistency in the PDS can lead to problems during the design process and may require unnecessary design iterations. This generally results in increased design time and cost. Currently, in many organizations, PDS are written using word processors. Since documents written by different authors can be inconsistent in style and word choice, it is difficult to automatically search for specific requirements. Moreover, this approach does not allow the possibility of automated design verification and validation against the design requirements and specifications. In this paper, we present a computational framework and a software tool based on this framework for writing, annotating, and searching computer-interpretable PDS. Our approach allows authors to write requirement statements in natural language to be consistent with the existing authoring practice. However, using mathematical expressions, keywords from predefined taxonomies, and other metadata the author of PDS can then annotate different parts of the requirement statements. This approach provides unambiguous meaning to the information contained in PDS, and helps to eliminate mistakes later in the process when designers must interpret requirements. Our approach also enables users to construct a new PDS document from the results of the search for requirements of similar devices and in similar contexts. This capability speeds up the process of creating PDS and helps authors write more detailed documents by utilizing previous, well written PDS documents. Our approach also enables checking for internal inconsistencies in the requirement statements.}

abstract = {The purpose of this report is to provide a perspective on the use of qualitative systems mapping, provide examples of physical activity (PA) systems maps, discuss the role of PA systems mapping in the context of iterative learning to derive breakthrough interventions, and provide actionable recommendations for future work. Systems mapping methods and applications for PA are emerging in the scientific literature in the study of complex health issues and can be used as a prelude to mathematical/computational modeling where important factors and relationships can be elucidated, data needs can be prioritized and guided, interventions can be tested and (co)designed, and metrics and evaluations can be developed. Examples are discussed that describe systems mapping based on Group Model Building or literature reviews. Systems maps are highly informative, illustrate multiple components to address PA and physical inactivity issues, and make compelling arguments against single intervention action. No studies were identified in the literature scan that considered cardiorespiratory fitness the focal point of a systems maps. Recommendations for future research and education are presented and it is concluded that systems mapping represents a valuable yet underutilized tool for visualizing the complexity of PA promotion.}

For over a century, theoretical and empirical investigations into this ability have focused on the role of binocular disparity in generating percepts of 3-D structure. Recent work in image segmentation demonstrates that stereovision can cause large changes in perceptual organization that cannot be understood on the basis of binocular disparity alone. It is argued that these phenomena reveal the need for theoretical tools beyond those that have dominated the study of visual perception over the past three decades.}

abstract = {This paper presents an innovative dual-branch solution designed for underwater image enhancement (UIE), leveraging the synergistic combination of Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) aware transformers and convolutional models. SNR-Net dynamically enhances pixel quality through spatial-varying operations. While transformers excel in capturing long-range dependencies, they face challenges in weak local relation learning. To address this, we introduce a SNR prior to guide transformer learning, incorporating a novel self-attention mechanism that avoids tokens from regions with very low SNR. Conversely, CNNs, optimized for exploiting local patterns, suffer from limited receptive fields and weak diversity representation. To overcome this limitation, we enhance the receptive field and multi-scale perception of CNNs by introducing a MR-ResNet module. Additionally, we incorporate a Selective Kernel Merging Module (SKMM), an attention-based feature merging module. These enhancements empower our approach to learn an enriched set of features that selectively combine contextual information from both branches while preserving high-quality spatial details. Finally, through knowledge distillation and contrastive learning, SNR-KD significantly reduces the number of parameters and computations of SNR-Net with minimal impact on performance. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our methods, namely SNR-Net and SNR-KD, demonstrating their state-of-the-art performance compared to other recent UIE methods. The code of our model is publicly available at: https://github.com/Alexande-rChan/SNR-UIE.}

abstract = {Risk and return are interdependent in a stock portfolio. To achieve the anticipated return, comparative risk should be considered simultaneously. However, complex investment environments and dynamic change in decision making criteria complicate forecasts of risk and return for various investment objects. Additionally, investors often fail to maximize their profits because of improper capital allocation. Although stock investment involves multi-criteria decision making (MCDM), traditional MCDM theory has two shortfalls: first, it is inappropriate for decisions that evolve with a changing environment; second, weight assignments for various criteria are often oversimplified and inconsistent with actual human thinking processes. In 1965, Rechenberg proposed evolution strategies for solving optimization problems involving real number parameters and addressed several flaws in traditional algorithms, such as their use of point search only and their high probability of falling into optimal solution area. In 1992, Hillis introduced the co-evolutionary concept that the evolution of living creatures is interactive with their environments (multi-criteria) and constantly improves the survivability of their genes, which then expedites evolutionary computation. Therefore, this research aimed to solve multi-criteria decision making problems of stock trading investment by integrating evolutionary strategies into the co-evolutionary criteria evaluation model. Since co-evolution strategies are self-calibrating, criteria evaluation can be based on changes in time and environment. Such changes not only correspond with human decision making patterns (i.e., evaluation of dynamic changes in criteria), but also address the weaknesses of multi-criteria decision making (i.e., simplified assignment of weights for various criteria). Co-evolutionary evolution strategies can identify the optimal capital portfolio and can help investors maximize their returns by optimizing the preoperational allocation of limited capital. This experimental study compared general evolution strategies with artificial neural forecast model, and found that co-evolutionary evolution strategies outperform general evolution strategies and substantially outperform artificial neural forecast models. The co-evolutionary criteria evaluation model avoids the problem of oversimplified adaptive functions adopted by general algorithms and the problem of favoring weights but failing to adaptively adjust to environmental change, which is a major limitation of traditional multi-criteria decision making. Doing so allows adaptation of various criteria in response to changes in various capital allocation chromosomes. Capital allocation chromosomes in the proposed model also adapt to various criteria and evolve in ways that resemble thinking patterns.}

This review covers literature between 2003–2021 The development and application of genome mining tools has given rise to ever-growing genetic and chemical databases and propelled natural products research into the modern age of Big Data. Likewise, an explosion of evolutionary studies has unveiled genetic patterns of natural products biosynthesis and function that support Darwin's theory of natural selection and other theories of adaptation and diversification. In this review, we aim to highlight how Big Data and evolutionary thinking converge in the study of natural products, and how this has led to an emerging sub-discipline of evolutionary genome mining of natural products. First, we outline general principles to best utilize Big Data in natural products research, addressing key considerations needed to provide evolutionary context. We then highlight successful examples where Big Data and evolutionary analyses have been combined to provide bioinformatic resources and tools for the discovery of novel natural products and their biosynthetic enzymes. Rather than an exhaustive list of evolution-driven discoveries, we highlight examples where Big Data and evolutionary thinking have been embraced for the evolutionary genome mining of natural products. After reviewing the nascent history of this sub-discipline, we discuss the challenges and opportunities of genomic and metabolomic tools with evolutionary foundations and/or implications and provide a future outlook for this emerging and exciting field of natural product research.}

From perceptual tasks to multiple-choice tests, research has shown that changes of mind often improve task performance by correcting initial errors. Decision makers must, however, strike a balance between improvements that might arise from changes of mind and potential energetic, temporal, and psychological costs. In this review, we provide an overview of the change-of-mind literature, focusing on key behavioral findings, computational mechanisms, and neural correlates. We propose a conceptual framework that comprises two core decision dimensions – time and evidence source – which link changes of mind across decision contexts, as a first step toward an integrated psychological account of changes of mind.}

We use the mean tardiness job sequencing problem to explore these issues. This paper is divided into two Parts.

abstract = {Groundwater models are essential for understanding aquifer systems behavior and effective water resources spatio-temporal distributions, yet they are often hindered by challenges related to model assumptions, parametrization, uncertainty, and computational efficiency. Machine intelligence, especially deep learning, promises a paradigm shift in overcoming these challenges. A critical examination of existing machine-driven methods reveals the inherent limitations, particularly in terms of the interpretability and the ability to generalize findings. To overcome these challenges, we develop a ternary framework that synergizes the valuable insights from multisource data, human expertise, and machine intelligence. This framework capitalizes on the distinct strengths of each element: the value and relevance of multisource data, the innovative capacity of human expertise, and the analytical efficiency of machine intelligence. Our goal is to conceptualize sustainable water management practices and enhance our understanding and predictive capabilities of groundwater systems. Unlike approaches that rely solely on abundant data, our framework emphasizes the quality and strategic use of available data, combined with human intellect and advanced computing, to overcome current limitations and pave the way for more realistic groundwater simulations.}
