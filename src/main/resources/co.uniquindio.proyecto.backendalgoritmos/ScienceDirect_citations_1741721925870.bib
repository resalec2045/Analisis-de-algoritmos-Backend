abstract = {In recent years, computer programming has reappeared in school curricula with the aim of transmitting knowledge and skills beyond the simple ability to code. However, there are different ways of teaching this subject and very few experimental studies compare plugged-in and unplugged programming learning. The purpose of this study is to highlight the impact of plugged-in or unplugged learning on students' performance and subjective experience. To this end, we designed an experimental study with 217 primary school students divided into two groups and we measured their knowledge of computational concepts, ability to solve algorithmic problem, motivation toward the instruction, self-belief and attitude toward science. The programming sessions were designed to be similar between the two conditions, only the tools were different. Computers and Scratch software were used in the plugged-in group while the unplugged group used paper instructions, pictures, figurines and body movements instead. The results show better learning performance in the plugged-in group. Furthermore, although motivation dropped slightly in both groups, this drop was only significant in the unplugged condition. Gender also seems to be an important factor, as girls exhibit a lower post-test motivation and a lower willingness to pursue their practice in programming outside the school context. However, this effect on motivation was only observable in the plugged-in group which suggests that educational programming software may have a positive but gendered motivational impact.}

In this paper, taking into consideration certain nonlinear waves in fluid dynamics, we investigate a generalized variable-coefficient version of the aforementioned equation. Making use of symbolic computation, with respect to the amplitude or elevation of the relevant wave, we construct out two sets of the similarity reductions, which rely on the variable coefficients in the generalized equation.}

abstract = {Comprehensive meta-analyses of risky decision making in children, adolescents, and adults have revealed that age trends in disambiguated laboratory tasks confirmed fuzzy-trace theory’s prediction that preference for risk decreases monotonically from childhood to adulthood. These findings are contrary to predictions of dual systems or neurobiological imbalance models. Assumptions about increasing developmental reliance on mental representations of the gist of risky options are essential to account for this developmental trend. However, dual systems theory appropriately emphasizes how cultural context changes behavioral manifestation of risk preferences across age and neurobiological imbalance models appropriately emphasize developmental changes in reward sensitivity. All of the major theories include the assumption of increasing behavioral inhibition. Here, we integrate these theoretical constructs—representation, cultural context, reward sensitivity, and behavioral inhibition—to provide a novel framework for understanding and improving risky decision making in youth. We also discuss the roles of critical tests, scientific falsification, disambiguating assessments of psychological and neurological processes, and the misuse of such concepts as ecological validity and reverse inference. We illustrate these concepts by extending fuzzy-trace theory to explain why youth are a major conduit of viral infections, including the virus that causes COVID-19. We conclude by encouraging behavioral scientists to embrace new ways of thinking about risky decision making that go beyond traditional stereotypes about adolescents and that go beyond conceptualizing ideal decision making as trading off degrees of risk and reward.}

Based on previous findings that individuals who avoid intimacy in relationships (avoidant individuals) contrast their self-concepts with primed friends whereas those who pursue intimacy in relationships (non-avoidant individuals) assimilate their self-concepts to primed friends [Gabriel, S., Carvallo, M., Dean, K., Tippin, B. D., & Renaud, J. (2005). How I see “Me” depends on how I see “We”: The role of avoidance of intimacy in social comparison. Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 31, 156–157], we predicted that friends who embody negative aspects of self would lead avoidant individuals to like themselves more, whereas friends who embody positive aspects of self would lead non-avoidant individuals to like themselves more. A pretest determined that good friends were seen as more similar to positive and ideal aspects of the self, whereas friends about whom participants had more mixed feelings (ambivalent friends) were seen as more similar to disliked and feared aspects of the self. Four experiments supported the main hypotheses. In Experiment 1, non-avoidant individuals like themselves more when good friends were primed. In Experiment 2, avoidant individuals like themselves more when ambivalent friends were primed. In Experiment 3, non-avoidant individuals liked themselves better after thinking about a friend’s positive traits, whereas avoidant individuals liked themselves better after thinking about a friend’s negative traits. In Experiment 4, all individuals under self-esteem threat strategically brought friends to mind who would help them like themselves more.}

In a previous study, we fit a computational model of perception to behavior on a heartbeat tapping task to test whether aberrant precision-weighting could explain misestimation of cardiac states in psychopathology. We found that, during an interoceptive perturbation designed to amplify afferent signal precision (inspiratory breath-holding), healthy individuals increased the precision-weighting assigned to ascending cardiac signals (relative to resting conditions), while individuals with anxiety, depression, substance use disorders, and/or eating disorders did not. In this pre-registered study, we aimed to replicate and extend our prior findings in a new transdiagnostic patient sample (N = 285) similar to the one in the original study. As expected, patients in this new sample were also unable to adjust beliefs about the precision of cardiac signals – preventing the ability to accurately perceive changes in their cardiac state. Follow-up analyses combining samples from the previous and current study (N = 719) also afforded power to identify group differences between narrower diagnostic categories, and to examine predictive accuracy when logistic regression models were trained on one sample and tested on the other. With this confirmatory evidence in place, future studies should examine the utility of interoceptive precision measures in predicting treatment outcomes and test whether these computational mechanisms might represent novel therapeutic targets.}

abstract = {A primary lesson of a beginning design studio is the development of a fundamental design competence. This entails acquiring skills of integration, projection, exploration, as well as critical thinking—forming the basis of thinking “like a designer”. Plaguing the beginning architectural design student as she develops this competence are three typical problems: a lagging visual intelligence, a linking of originality with creativity, and the belief that design is an act of an individual author instead of a collaborative activity. We believe that computation support for design learning has particular attributes for helping students overcome these problems. These attributes include its inherent qualities for visualization, for explicitness, and for sharing. This paper describes five interactive multi-media exercises exploiting these attributes which were developed to support a beginning design studio. The paper also reports how they have been integrated into the course curriculum. Le développement des compétences en design: support on-line pour le studio de design élémentaire Une des premières leçons lors du studio de design est le développement d’une compétence fondamentale en conception. Ceci implique l’acquisition des habiletés d’intégration, de projection, d’exploration ainsi que la pensée critique—antérieurement les bases de la façon de penser nommée “comme un concepteur”. Il y a trois problèmes fondamentaux qui pèsent sur l’étudiant débutant en architecture lors du développement cette compétence: une intelligence visuelle insuffisante, le fait de lier l’originalité à la créativité, et la croyance que le processus de conception est une activité individuelle, plutôt que collaborative. Nous sommes de l’avis que le soutien en informatique lors de l’apprentissage de la conception architecturale posséde des attributs bien particuliers pour aider les étudiants à surmonter ces difficultés. Ces attributs comprennent des qualités inhérentes pour la visualisation, pour être explicite, et pour le partage. Ce papier décrit cinq exercices de médias interactifs qui exploitent ces attributs, et qui ont été développés pour supporter un studio de design élémentaire. Il présente aussi un reportage sur la façon dont ces exercices ont été intégrés dans le curriculum du cours.}

In contrast to these nativist assumptions about the role of biology in morality, we present an alternative approach based on a relational developmental systems view of moral development. The role for biology in this approach is in setting up the conditions—the developmental system—in which forms of interaction and later forms of thinking emerge.}

With this tool, students can create projects of digital stories by building personalized AR artifacts, scenes, and storylines, and then share their projects in a dynamic and global community of children. This study examined the characteristics of 39 selected CoSpaces’ open projects via thematic analysis and categorization into five learning contexts: (1) art, history, culture and design, (2) STEM, (3) classroom English and everyday communication, (4) fairy tale/literature, and (5) campus tour. Furthermore, this study identified six language learning competencies derived from digital story creation: (1) discovering knowledge, (2) connecting to prior experience and knowledge, (3) conducting research, (4) problem-solving, (5) expressing and creating digitally, as well as (6) presenting, appreciating and evaluating. Digital literacy refers to the ability to use technology to find, evaluate, create, and communicate information. In addition, three major types of digital literacy skills necessary for AR digital storytelling processes have been identified, encompassing digital creativity, technoligcal proficiency, and research skills. Our results contribute to discovering educational values in developing digital language competency through AR digital story creation.

abstract = {This study focuses on ways to systematically evaluate stakeholder requirements when developing a smart industrial service ecosystem (SISE) in a complex industrial context. The SISE development requires considering the service requirement from both the complex industrial context and service ecosystem manners. This study proposes a systematic framework for stakeholder requirement evaluation in SISE. The first part of the framework is the industrial context-viable system model with ecological thinking (IC-VESM) to elicit the service requirements for the SISE, which facilitates a systematic analysis of the service value proposition and service requirement elicitation in the operational lifecycle of an entire industrial context. This second part of the framework proposes a method for evaluating service requirements that is both feasible and systematic. This is achieved by combining the Fuzzy Kano and AHP methods in a Pythagorean fuzzy (PF) environment. The PF Kano computes the categories and determines the weights of service requirements from a consumer perspective, while the PF AHP hierarchically analyzes the service requirements and provides pairwise comparison paths for design experts. Finally, an illustrative case study in a renewable energy context was used to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the methodology. The proposed theoretical model provides more reliable and systematic outcomes than traditional methods when eliciting service requirements and evaluating complex smart industrial service solutions. The study has practical implications by providing useful insights for companies to recognize key smart service requirements in complex industrial contexts and to improve sustainable development.}

Many papers show that PNNs can approximate a wide variety of functions, but comparatively, very few discuss their limitations and the scope of this paper. To this aim, we define two classes of Boolean functions – sensitive and robust –, and prove that an exponentially large set of sensitive functions are exponentially difficult to compute by multi-layer PNNs (hence incomputable by single-layer PNNs). A comparatively large set of functions in the second one, but not all, are computable by single-layer PNNs. Finally, we used polynomial threshold PNNs to compute all Boolean functions with quantum annealing and present in detail a QUBO computation on the D-Wave Advantage. These results confirm that the successes of PNNs, or lack of them, are in part determined by properties of the learned data sets and suggest that sensitive functions may not be (efficiently) computed by PNNs.}

abstract = {Decades of psychological research have demonstrated that intuitive judgments are often unreliable, thanks to their inflexible reliance on limited information (Kahneman, 2003, 2011). Research on the computational underpinnings of learning, however, indicates that intuitions may be acquired by sophisticated learning mechanisms that are highly sensitive and integrative. With this in mind, Railton (2014) urges a more optimistic view of moral intuition. Is such optimism warranted? Elsewhere (Greene, 2013) I’ve argued that moral intuitions offer reasonably good advice concerning the give-and-take of everyday social life, addressing the basic problem of cooperation within a “tribe” (“Me vs. Us”), but that moral intuitions offer unreliable advice concerning disagreements between tribes with competing interests and values (“Us vs. Them”). Here I argue that a computational perspective on moral learning underscores these conclusions. The acquisition of good moral intuitions requires both good (representative) data and good (value-aligned) training. In the case of inter-tribal disagreement (public moral controversy), the problem of bad training looms large, as training processes may simply reinforce tribal differences. With respect to moral philosophy and the paradoxical problems it addresses, the problem of bad data looms large, as theorists seek principles that minimize counter-intuitive implications, not only in typical real-world cases, but in unusual, often hypothetical, cases such as some trolley dilemmas. In such cases the prevailing real-world relationships between actions and consequences are severed or reversed, yielding intuitions that give the right answers to the wrong questions. Such intuitions—which we may experience as the voice of duty or virtue—may simply reflect the computational limitations inherent in affective learning. I conclude, in optimistic agreement with Railton, that progress in moral philosophy depends on our having a better understanding of the mechanisms behind our moral intuitions.}

Policy makers can use models and theories to guide this process at the individuals, groups, and communities levels. Individuals can have multiple risky health behaviors including physical inactivity, unhealthy diets, smoking, and alcohol drinking that are often shaped by social and ecological factors. Collective understanding of these factors can provide ability to design and evaluate intervention programs that can change unhealthy or risky behaviors over long period of time. However, it is overwhelming task to optimize intervention based on only empirical and/or cross-sectional studies. Effective long lasting intervention needs a thorough understanding of the role of social and environmental mechanisms at multiple scales on the dynamics of health behaviors. Recent mathematical and computational methods developed in other fields, such as epidemiology and finance, can provide systematic and in-depth understanding of mechanisms. However, the use of such methods in social and behaviors sciences have been limited. In this chapter, some real life working examples of social health behaviors problems are provided which uses some cutting edge methods from dynamical systems and data mining to uncertainty quantification.}

Here, I disambiguate several ways in which a choice can be value-laden and show that this disambiguation has the potential to solve and dissolve philosophical problems about values in science. First, I characterize four ways in which values relate to choices: values can motivate, justify, cause, or be impacted by the choices we make. Next, I put my proposed taxonomy to work, using it to clarify one version of the argument from inductive risk. The claim that non-epistemic values must play a role in scientific choices that run inductive risk makes most sense as a claim about values being needed to justify such choices. The argument from inductive risk is not unique: many philosophical arguments about values in science can be more clearly understood and assessed by paying close attention to how values and choices are related.}

abstract = {Background
Access to mathematics instruction that involves opportunities for critical thinking and procedural fluency promotes mathematics learning. Studies have outlined effective strategies for teaching mathematics to children on the autism spectrum, however, the focus of these interventions often represent a narrow set of mathematical skills and concepts centered on procedural learning without linking ideas to underlying concepts.
Methods
This study utilized classroom video observations to evaluate the variability in and nature of mathematical learning opportunities presented to 76 autistic students within 49 preschool–3rd grade general and special education learning contexts. We examined teacher instructional practices and student participation across 109 mathematical tasks within larger mathematics lessons.
Results
Students were most often presented with mathematical tasks that required low-level cognitive demand, such as tasks focusing on rote memorization and practicing predetermined steps to solve basic algorithms. Furthermore, the nature of the mathematical task was linked with the language that teachers used, and this in turn, was associated with students’ participation within the learning opportunity.
Conclusions
Our findings indicate that features of talk within specific types of mathematical tasks, including math-related talk and responsive language, were associated with increased student active engagement and spontaneous communication. The knowledge gained from this study contributes to the development of optimized instructional practices for school-aged children on the autism spectrum—information that could be used to prepare both preservice and in-service teachers.}

The sample consisted of 407 participants who were recruited at index hospitalization and evaluated over six follow-ups over 20 years. The symptom structure associated with thought insertion included auditory verbal hallucinations, somatic hallucinations, other hallucinations, delusions of thought-dissemination, delusions of control, delusion of self-depreciation, depersonalization and anxiety. The symptom constellation of thought withdrawal included somatic hallucinations, other hallucinations, delusions of thought dissemination, delusions of control, sexual delusions, depersonalization, negative symptoms, depression, and anxiety. The symptom constellation of thought broadcasting included auditory verbal hallucinations, somatic hallucinations, delusions of thought-dissemination, delusion of self-depreciation, fantastic delusions, sexual delusions, and depersonalization. Auditory verbal hallucinations and delusions of self-depreciation were significantly associated with both thought insertion and thought broadcasting. Thought insertion and thought withdrawal were significantly associated with other hallucinations, delusions of control, and anxiety; thought withdrawal and thought broadcasting were significantly related to sexual delusions. We hypothesize that specific symptom constellations over time might be explained as the product of pseudo-coherent realities created to give meaning to the experience of the world and the self of individuals in psychosis based on both prior top-down and ongoing bottom-up elements.}

Quantitative computational models are necessary when analyzing energy, and more specifically electricity, systems, as they are technologically-complex systems that can diverge from intuitive patterns. To assure energy justice, these models must be reflective of, and informative to, a wide range of stakeholders, including households and communities alongside utilities, governments, and others. Yet, moving from a qualitative understanding of preferences to quantitative modeling is challenging. In this perspective piece, we pilot the use of the value-focused thinking framework to inform stakeholder engagement. The result is a strategic objective hierarchy that highlights the tradeoffs and the social, economic and technological factors that need to be measured in models. We apply the process in Ghana, using a survey, stakeholder workshops, and follow-up interviews to uncover key tradeoffs and stakeholder-derived objectives. We discuss three key areas that have been rarely, if ever, well-represented in energy models: (1) the relationship between the dynamics of electricity end-use and the technology and economic structure of the system; (2) explicit tradeoffs between electricity access, cost, and reliability as defined by stakeholders; and (3) the definition of new objectives, such as minimizing hazards related to theft. We conclude that this model of engagement provides an opportunity to tie together rigorous qualitative analysis and stakeholder engagement with crucial quantitative models of the electricity system.}

The turbinate enlargement or “hypertrophy” is neither the cause nor a complication of hearing loss. Fortunately, and for the most part, dazed blunders and egregious errors in thinking by esteemed experts, for the most part, have remedied itself through scientific studies, since the late 19th century. This chapter traces the more than a century long history of turbinate thinking and surgery offering both sides of the turbinate debate in their “own words.” All the various procedures used to reduce the inferior turbinate are presented. To be as fair minded as possible, numerous authors are quoted, spanning more than one hundred years; some observed and reported the serious adverse effects of aggressive turbinate surgery, pleading for a conservative approach to inferior turbinate surgical intervention, while others claimed that turbinectomy was without any serious sequelae which is challenged by the facts.}

The underlying visualization model is declarative in the sense that visualization is treated as a mapping from program states to a three-dimensional world of geometric objects. The latter is rendered in full color and may be examined freely by a viewer who is allowed to navigate through the geometric world. The state-to-geometry mapping is defined as a composition of several simpler mappings. The choice is determined by methodological and architectural considerations. This paper shows how this decomposition was molded by two methodological objectives: (1) the desire visually to capture abstract formal properties of programs (e.g. safety and progress) rather than operational details; and (2) the need to support complex animations of atomic computational events. All mappings are specified using a rule-based notation; rules may be added, deleted and modified at any time during the visualization. An algorithm for termination detection in diffusing computations is used to illustrate the specification method and to demonstrate its conceptual elegance and flexibility. A concurrent version of a popular artificial intelligence program provides a vehicle for demonstrating how we derive graphical representations and animation scenarios from key formal properties of the program, i.e. from those safety and progress assertions about the program which turn out to be important in verifying its correctness.}

abstract = {Background
Increasingly, survey researchers rely on hybrid samples to improve coverage and increase the number of respondents by combining independent samples. For instance, it is possible to combine 2 probability samples with one relying on telephone and another on mail. More commonly, however, researchers are now supplementing probability samples with those from online panels that are less costly. Setting aside ad hoc approaches that are void of rigor, traditionally, the method of composite estimation has been used to blend results from different sample surveys. This means individual point estimates from different surveys are pooled together, 1 estimate at a time. Given that for a typical study many estimates must be produced, this piecemeal approach is computationally burdensome and subject to the inferential limitations of the individual surveys that are used in this process.
Objective
In this paper, we will provide a comprehensive review of the traditional method of composite estimation. Subsequently, the method of composite weighting is introduced, which is significantly more efficient, both computationally and inferentially when pooling data from multiple surveys. With the growing interest in hybrid sampling alternatives, we hope to offer an accessible methodology for improving the efficiency of inferences from such sample surveys without sacrificing rigor.
Methods
Specifically, we will illustrate why the many ad hoc procedures for blending survey data from multiple surveys are void of scientific integrity and subject to misleading inferences. Moreover, we will demonstrate how the traditional approach of composite estimation fails to offer a pragmatic and scalable solution in practice. By relying on theoretical and empirical justifications, in contrast, we will show how our proposed methodology of composite weighting is both scientifically sound and inferentially and computationally superior to the old method of composite estimation.
Results
Using data from 3 large surveys that have relied on hybrid samples composed of probability-based and supplemental sample components from online panels, we illustrate that our proposed method of composite weighting is superior to the traditional method of composite estimation in 2 distinct ways. Computationally, it is vastly less demanding and hence more accessible for practitioners. Inferentially, it produces more efficient estimates with higher levels of external validity when pooling data from multiple surveys.
Conclusions
The new realities of the digital age have brought about a number of resilient challenges for survey researchers, which in turn have exposed some of the inefficiencies associated with the traditional methods this community has relied upon for decades. The resilience of such challenges suggests that piecemeal approaches that may have limited applicability or restricted accessibility will prove to be inadequate and transient. It is from this perspective that our proposed method of composite weighting has aimed to introduce a durable and accessible solution for hybrid sample surveys.}

The quick and accurate division of large datasets with a range of properties or features becomes challenging. The parallel implementation of clustering algorithms must satisfy stringent computational requirements to handle large amounts of data. This can be achieved by designing a GPU based optimal computational model with a heuristic approach. Swarm Intelligence (SI), a family of bio-inspired algorithms, that has been effectively applied to a number of real-world clustering problems. The Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA) is a heuristic search optimization approach based on Newton's Law of Gravitation and mass interactions. Although it has a slow searching rate in the last iterations, this strategy has been proved to be capable of discovering the global optimum. This paper presents GPU based hybrid parallel algorithms for data clustering. A newly developed, hybrid Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA) i.e., PSOGSA achieves the global optima. PSOGSA utilizes novel training methods for enhanced Neural Networks (NN) in order to examine the efficiency of algorithms and resolves the challenges of trapping in local minima. This also shows the sluggish convergence rate of standard evolutionary learning algorithms. The Nearest Neighbour Partition (Partitioning of the Neighbourhood) algorithm can be used to improve the performance of NN. A parallel version of Hybrid PSOGSA with NN is implemented to achieve optimal results with better computational time. Compared to the CPU-based regular PSO, the suggested Hybrid PSOGSA with NN achieved optimal clustering with 71% improved computational time.}

The model uses a recurrent network structure as the main framework to extract historical information, and fuse the historical information with the current concerned information. At each recurrent time step, it can pay attention to the fused information, especially pay more attention to the information that may have objects. Experimental results show that the proposed method has more than 5% improved in recognition accuracy to the conventional methods. In terms of FLOPs, the conventional methods normally require 170 M, while the proposed method only needs 25.4M This means that the proposed method has higher detection efficiency.}

abstract = {Construction industry is the largest global consumer of materials. This huge share comes with the huge responsibility to account for economic, environmental, and social impacts associated with the materials through adoption of sustainable procurement strategies. Sustainable material procurement requires reconciliation among economic, environmental and social impacts of procurement decisions throughout the life cycle of materials. However, this is challenging mainly due to the broad range of economic, environmental and social impacts associated with different stages of material’s life cycle as well as the overlapping impacts that various supply decisions may have on multiple performance areas. Current practices of material procurement are, on the other hand, predominantly influenced by economy of construction stage and little attention is paid to environmental and social considerations over a long-term horizon. Moreover, material supply decisions made currently in practice are commonly traditional and tend to largely overlook the opportunities made available by advances in material science, computing, and decision-making areas. This chapter starts by presenting an overview of sustainability challenges associated with current material procurement practices to highlight the need for adoption of new sustainable approaches and technologies. It then continues by highlighting the challenges associated with adoption of new approaches and the important sustainability criteria to be considered in selection of new sustainable materials, technologies, and procurement strategies. A comprehensive decision-making framework for identifying the most sustainable procurement options in a construction project among various procurement options available is then presented. The framework is founded on the concepts of life cycle thinking and supply chain structure which are incorporated in to a computational module to compare the life cycle impacts of various supply decision based on the selection criteria determined collaboratively by different project stakeholders. The results of such comparative analysis leads to a ranking of various procurement decision alternatives comprised of different combinations of supply decision including material type, material supply structure, location of supplier, and mode of transport.}

The viewpoint is that of constructing large scale simulations that bridge micro- and macro-length and time scales on state-of-the-art parallel supercomputers. Because of long range interactions, fast communications are the key to scalable N-Body algorithms. The communication scheduling strategies of Fuentes and Kim are examined in two contexts on the Thinking Machines CM-5 parallel computer. First, an N-Body simulation implementation in C using the standard send-receive message passing primitives in the CMMD 2.0 library shows that communication scheduling leads to dramatic improvements in computational performance. Second, an implementation in Split-C, which uses highly efficient activemessages to implement shared memory communication, reduces communication overhead by an order of magnitude. Taken together, these two developments portend great promise for the development of efficient large scale simulations using portable, high level parallel programming languages.}

abstract = {2012 and 2013 have been challenging years for Computer Science (CS) education in the UK. After decades of national neglect, there has been a sudden impetus to reintroduce CS into the 11-16 age school curriculums. Immediate obstacles include a generation of children with no CS background and an estimated need for 20,000 new CS teachers - existing UK IT teachers being insufficiently qualified and experienced. The Computing at School (CAS) movement has been instrumental in this quantum transition from an IT to Computing syllabus, as have the British Computer Society (BCS), leading UK universities and a number of major international technology companies, including Microsoft, Google, IBM, British Telecom and Facebook.This paper discusses the background to this position and the progress being made to address these challenges. It describes, in particular, the work of the BCS-funded Glyndwr University ‘Turing Project’ in introducing Welsh high-school students and staff to high-level programming and ‘computational thinking’. The Turing Project uses an innovative combination of Lego NXT Mindstorm robots, Raspberry Pi computers and PicoBoard hardware together with the Robot C and Scratch programming platforms. The paper discusses initial objectives and the general approach, describes focused delivery across different age groups and ability ranges and presents results and analysis demonstrating the effectiveness of the programme.

Every problem in computing can be cast as decision problems of whether strings are in a language or not. Computations and language recognition are carried out by three classes of automata, the most complex of which is the Turing machine. Living systems compute using biochemistry; in the artificial, computation today is mostly electronic. Thinking of chemical reactions as molecular recognition machines, and without using biochemistry, we realize one automaton in each class by means of one-pot, table top chemical reactors: from the simplest, Finite automata, to the most complex, Turing machines. Language acceptance/rejection criteria by automata can be formulated using energy considerations. Our Turing machine uses the Belousov-Zhabotinsky chemical reaction and checks the same symbol in an Avogadro′s number of processors. Our findings have implications for chemical and general computing, artificial intelligence, bioengineering, the study of the origin and presence of life on other planets, and for artificial biology.}

abstract = {Computer simulations are ideally suited to study systems under arbitrary constraints; hence they are useful for the investigation of metastability. Different types of constraints were applied to the three-dimensional Lennard—Jones fluid in the vapor—liquid coexistence region. Constraining the magnitude of allowed density fluctuations (restricted ensemble) has little effect on the equation of state and on phase equilibrium predictions for reduced temperatures lower than 0.95. Thermodynamic integrations along constrained and unstable paths are in good agreement with chemical potential calculations, indicating that imposing the density constraint does not violate microscopic reversibility. Restricted ensemble calculations were also used to calculate the width of the transition region where the mechanism of phase separation in the superheated liquid changes from nucleation to spinodal decomposition. The width of this region decreases as the temperature is reduced away from criticality. Free energy barriers to isotropic compression were used to determine the width of the transition region from nucleation to spinodal decomposition in the supercooled vapor. This transition region also becomes narrower as the distance from the critical point increases. The pressure of the deeply superheated liquid was found to be sensitive to the maximum size of voids that are allowed to form.}

Majority of remote sensing user community comes from natural and social sciences domain while remote sensing technology evolves from physical and engineering sciences. To ensure inculcation and internalization of remote sensing technology by application/resource scientists, trainer needs to transfer physical and engineering concepts in geometric manner. Here, the steering for the transfer of knowledge (facts, procedures, concepts and principles) and skills (thinking, acting, reacting and interacting) needs to take the trainees from Known to Unknown, Concrete to Abstract, Observation to Theory and Simple to Complex. In the initial stage of training/education, experiential learning by instructor led exploring of thematic details in false colour composite (FCC) as well as in individual black and white spectral band(s) imagery by trainees not only creates interest, confidence build-up and orientation towards purposeful learning but also helps them to overcome their inhibitions towards the physical and engineering basal. The methodology to be adopted has to inculcate productive learning, emphasizing more on thinking and trial and error aspects as opposed to reproductive learning based dominantly on being told and imitation. The delivery by trainer needs to ensure dynamic, stimulating and effective discussions through deluging questions pertaining to analysis, synthesis and evaluation nature. This would ensure proactive participation from trainees. Hands-on module leads to creative concretization of concepts. To keep the trainees inspired to learn in an auto mode during post-training period, they need to consciously swim in the current and emerging knowledge pool during training programme. This is achieved through assignment of seminar delivery task to the trainees. During the delivery of seminar, peers and co-trainees drive the trainee to communicate the seminar content not only in what but also in how and why mode. The interest culminated in this manner keeps the entropy of the trainee minimized even during post-training professional life. So, such germinated trainee would always generate positive induction among colleagues; thus, helping in realizing multiplier effect. Based upon above thought process(es), the paper discusses the concept of “thinking curricula” and associated cares needed in training deliveries.}

abstract = {To power microelectronics for the internet-of-things applications, high-performance miniature batteries, called microbatteries, are critically important. Given their limited size, the three-dimensional design of microbatteries is key to maximizing their performance. Therefore, a computational strategy to identify the target battery architecture has major implications for performance improvement. In this paper, we propose a data-driven 3D battery optimization system at the full cell level that combines an automatic geometry generator based on Monte Carlo Tree Search and highly accurate machine-learning-based performance simulators. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated by designing high-performance 3D batteries with more than 5.5 times efficiency compared with the approach based on a randomized algorithm. One of the designed geometries displayed greater power and energy densities due to more than 10% reduced internal resistance than the reported state-of-the-art geometry at the current density of higher than 15.8 mA/cm2. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.}

The computational hypothesis, irrespective of any particular experimental outcomes, has been claimed to carry some rather specific implications for the semantics of natural language. The purpose of the chapter is to criticize that claim. The chapter is occupied solely with the implications of the computational hypothesis and not at all with its merits as a strategy for scientific research. The computational hypothesis, which has come to dominate cognitive psychology, in the sense that it expects the computational analogy to be more successful than any other in generating a variety of theories that are not only testable, but also worthwhile testing, about how particular mental processes operate. Memory, visual imagery, concept formation, problem solving, speech comprehension, etc., are treated as fields of research in which experiments may be used to test theories that such-and-such a combination of iteration, recursion, chunking, horizontal searching, vertical searching, geometrical coding, linguistic coding or other mode of information-processing is at work. Commonly the researcher first constructs or sketches or surveys a suitably wide range of computer-programs (implementable on a suitably wide range of computer-architectures) that, when compared with the mental process in question, would provide analogous outputs for analogous inputs. He then devises experiments on the performance of human subjects to determine, which of these computer-simulations is closest to the kind of explanatory mechanism required by the results of the experiments.}

Linguistic abnormalities range from prosodic differences in pitch, intensity, and rate of speech, to language idiosyncrasies and difficulties with pragmatics and reciprocal conversation. Heterogeneity of findings and a reliance on qualitative, subjective ratings, however, limit a full understanding of linguistic phenotypes in autism. This review summarizes evidence of both speech and language differences in ASD. We also describe recent advances in linguistic research, aided by automated methods and software like natural language processing (NLP) and speech analytic software. Such approaches allow for objective, quantitative measurement of speech and language patterns that may be more tractable and unbiased. Future research integrating both speech and language features and capturing “natural language” samples may yield a more comprehensive understanding of language differences in autism, offering potential implications for diagnosis, intervention, and research.}

abstract = {Throughout history, symmetry has been widely explored as a geometric strategy to conceive architectural forms and spaces. Nonetheless, its concept has changed and expanded overtime. Nowadays, it is understood as an ordering principle resulting from the application of isometric transformations that keep the original object invariant. Departing from this notion, scientists, philosophers and designers have extended it to embrace other geometric scenarios. Following this idea, exploring symmetry does not mean the generation of simple and predictable design solutions. On the contrary, it is a creative window to achieve geometric complexity based on very simple rules. In this context, this paper aims at discussing the relevance of exploring symmetry in architectural design today by means of digital technologies. It argues that the coupled use of computational design and digital fabrication processes allows designers to explore and materialize a higher level of design complexity in a structured and controlled way, especially when non-isometric transformations are involved. As the background for testing and illustrating its arguments, this paper describes a teaching experiment conducted in the Constructive Geometry course at the FAUP, following design-to-fabrication methodologies.}

However, researchers are finding some unexpected effects of scaffolding on strategy development and problem-solving behaviors. We used a digital Sudoku game named Professor Sudoku to classify built-in critical features, frustration control and demonstration scaffolds, and to investigate their effects on player/learner behaviors. Our data indicate that scaffolding support increased the level at which puzzles could be solved, and decreased frustration resulting from excessive numbers of retries. However, it also reduced the number of unassisted placements (i.e., independently filled cells), and increased reliance on scaffolding tools, both of which are considered disadvantageous for learning. Among the three scaffold types, frustration control reduced the potential for players to feel stuck at certain levels, but also reduced the frequency of use of critical feature-making tools, which are thought to have greater heuristic value. We conclude that the simultaneous provision of critical feature and frustration control scaffolds may increase player reliance on available support, thereby reducing learning opportunities. Providing players with critical features and demonstration scaffolds at the same time increases reliance on available support for some players, but for most it encourages the development of solving strategies.}

This chapter discusses various aspects of biological perspectives on creativity. Some of the research on creativity as of late involves the brain and biological correlates of originality, novelty, and insight. Handedness is sometimes used as an indication of hemispheric dominance or hemisphericity, with right-handed people being compared to left-handed people. There are several reports of left-handed persons outnumbering the right-handed in creative and eminent samples. Hemisphericity and other important brain structures and processes contributing to creative thinking and behavior have been studied with EEG, PET, cerebral blood flow, and MRI techniques. Numerous EEG studies suggest that there are particular brain-wave patterns and brain structures that are associated with creative problem solving, or at least specific phases within the problem solving process. EEGs suggest a complex kind of activity while individuals work on divergent thinking tasks. The complexity disappears when those same individuals work on convergent thinking tasks. It is found that the role of the prefrontal cortex in creative thinking and behavior comes from several sources and uses different methodologies.}

In this work, we propose a novel Demonstrative Self-TrAining fRamework (D-STAR) that leverages multi-perspective thought navigation. D-STAR iteratively optimizes a question generator and an entity retriever by navigating thoughts on a dynamic graph reasoning across multiple perspectives for question generation. The generated question–answer pairs, along with hard negatives shared in the graph, enable adaptation with minimal computational overhead. Additionally, we introduce a new task, source-free entity linking, focusing on unsupervised transfer learning without direct access to original domain data. To demonstrate the feasibility of this task, we provide a generated question–answering dataset, FandomWiki, for novel entities. Our experiments show that D-STAR significantly improves baselines on SciFact, Zeshel, and FandomWiki.}

Noise-aware flight trajectory planning can address UAM’s community noise concerns. However, the traditional trajectory optimization paradigm requires repetitive computations of a flight’s noise footprints in complex urban environments and is computationally expensive. In this work, we propose virtual acoustic terrain, a novel concept to enable an efficient trajectory optimization paradigm. By applying acoustic ray tracing and the principle of reciprocity in a complex urban environment, we convert different noise constraints into 3D exclusion zones which UAM operations should avoid to maintain limited noise impact. It combines with the physical urban terrain to define an acceptable fly zone for non-repetitive noise-aware trajectory optimization. This framework provides a new angle to future urban area airspace management and can also accommodate other forms of societal constraints.}

Attention Training Technique (ATT) is a key therapeutic tool in metacognitive therapy. There are numerous studies on the behavioral effects of ATT, however the neural mechanisms at work in the training are yet to be uncovered. To date there have been no controlled fMRI studies of ATT.
Method
We conducted a randomized double-blind controlled study of two groups with varying levels of cognitive-attentional syndrome (CAS). Groups with high (n = 43) and low (n = 46) levels of CAS underwent a single session of ATT or a control condition (CON) in an MRI scanner. Participants underwent resting state functional MRI (rsfMRI) sessions and rumination induction sessions both pre- and post-intervention Functional connectivity analyses and inter-subject correlations analyses were computed. We also collected data on emotion and attention functioning pre- and post-intervention.
Results
We did not observe any behavioral effects of ATT. However, direct comparison between ATT and CON sessions revealed greater inter-subject correlations in almost all hubs belonging to the studied functional networks. Moreover, subjects who received ATT showed diminished connectivity in the fronto-parietal network during ruminations and diminished connectivity of the precuneus with lateral occipital cortices and the intraparietal sulcus in abstract thinking and rsfMRI, respectively. Furthermore, some of the observed effects in functional connectivity and inter-subject correlations were specific to different levels of CAS.
Conclusions
Our results may support a proposed neural mechanism for ATT: disengagement of attention from CAS-type processing in either low- or high-CAS individuals. It is also possible that some neural effects of ATT are specific to individuals with different levels of CAS.}

Equally the relationship between catastrophic misinterpretation and health anxiety should be moderated by metacognition, in particular negative beliefs about the uncontrollability and danger of thinking (MCQNeg). Participants (N=351) completed measures to examine the relationship between these variables. Results indicated positive relationships between metacognition, catastrophic misinterpretation, and health anxiety. Moderation analysis showed that the effect of catastrophic misinterpretations on health anxiety was explained by the proposed interaction with metacognition. Follow-up regression analysis demonstrated the interaction term explained variance in health anxiety when controlling for other variables, and was a stronger unique predictor of health anxiety than catastrophic misinterpretation. Metacognition appears to be an important factor in the relationship between catastrophic misinterpretation and health anxiety, and would have important implications for existing models and treatment.}

Then, we formalize linguistic rules based on complex linguistic data summaries, in which, the degree of confidence of linguistic rules from a data set can be explained by linguistic quantifiers and its linguistic truth from the fuzzy logical point of view. In order to obtain a linguistic rule with a higher degree of linguistic truth, a genetic algorithm is used to optimize the number and parameters of membership functions of linguistic values. Computational results show that the proposed method is an alternative method for extracting linguistic rules with linguistic truth from data sets.}

The impetus for UHC has led to an increased demand for time-sensitive tools to enhance our knowledge of how health systems function and to evaluate impact of system interventions. We define the field of “health system modeling” (HSM) as an area of research where dynamic mathematical models can be designed in order to describe, predict, and quantitatively capture the functioning of health systems. HSM can be used to explore the dynamic relationships among different system components, including organizational design, financing and other resources (such as investments in resources and supply chain management systems) – what we call “inputs” – on access, coverage, and quality of care – what we call “outputs”, toward improved health system “outcomes”, namely increased levels and fairer distributions of population health and financial risk protection. We undertook a systematic review to identify the existing approaches used in HSM. We identified “systems thinking” – a conceptual and qualitative description of the critical interactions within a health system – as an important underlying precursor to HSM, and collated a critical collection of such articles. We then reviewed and categorized articles from two schools of thoughts: “system dynamics” (SD)” and “susceptible-infected-recovered-plus” (SIR+). SD emphasizes the notion of accumulations of stocks in the system, inflows and outflows, and causal feedback structure to predict intended and unintended consequences of policy interventions. The SIR + models link a typical disease transmission model with another that captures certain aspects of the system that impact the outcomes of the main model. These existing methods provide critical insights in informing the design of HSM, and provide a departure point to extend this research agenda. We highlight the opportunity to advance modeling methods to further understand the dynamics between health system inputs and outputs.}

Six input parameters were used which represent geometric and mechanical properties of the bars as well as shear features. These parameters are: web width, tensile reinforcement depth, ratio of shear and depth, concrete compressive strength, ratio of FRP reinforcement, FRP modulus of elasticity and beam shear resistance. The searching algorithm is based on combination of artificial neural network and fuzzy logic principle or adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). Based on the obtained results ratio of shear and depth has the strongest influence on the prediction of shear resistance of reinforced concrete beams by FRP. Moreover, combination of tensile reinforcement depth and ratio of shear and depth is the most influential combination of two parameters on the prediction of shear resistance of reinforced concrete beams by FRP.

In that respect logic programming languages are as careless as conventional computation: they ignore the fact that floating-point operations are only approximate and that it is not easy to tell how good the approximation is. It is our aim to extend the benefits of logic programming to computation involving floating-point arithmetic. Our starting points are the ideas of Cleary and the CHIP programming language. Cleary proposed a relational form of interval arithmetic that was incorporated in BNR Prolog in such a way that variables already bound can be bound again. In this way the usual logical interpretation of computation no longer holds. In this paper we develop a technique for narrowing intervals that we relate both to Cleary's work and to the constraint-satisfaction techniques of artificial intelligence. We then modify CHIP by allowing domains to be intervals of real numbers. To reduce arithmetic primitives with interval domains, we use our interval narrowing technique as an implementation of the looking-ahead inference rule. We show that the result is a system where answers are logical consequences of a declarative logic program, even when floating-point computations have been used. We believe ours is the first system with this property.}

abstract = {This paper describes several parallel algorithms that solve geometric problems. The algorithms are based on a vector model of computation-the scan model. The purpose of this paper is both to show how the model can be used and to formulate a set of practical algorithms. The scan model is based on a small set of operations on vectors of atomic values. It differs from the P-RAM models both in that it includes a set of scan primitives, also called parallel prefix computations, and in that it is a strictly data-parallel model. A very useful abstraction in the scan model is the segment abstraction, the subdivision of a vector into a collection of independent smaller vectors. The segment abstraction permits a clean formulation of divide-and-conquer algorithms and is used heavily in the algorithms described in this paper. Within the scan model, using the operations and routines defined, the paper describes a k-D tree algorithm requiring O(lg n) calls to the primitives for n points, a closest-pair algorithm requiring O(lg n) calls to the primitives, a line-drawing algorithm requiring O(1) calls to the primitives, a line-of-sight algorithm requiring O(1) calls to the primitives, and finally, three different convex-hull algorithms. The last convex-hull algorithm, merge-hull, utilizes a generalized binary search technique using divide-and-conquer with the segment abstraction. The paper also describes how to implement the CREW version of Cole's merge sort in O(lg n) calls to the primitives. All these algorithms should be noted for their simplicity rather than their complexity; many of them are parallel versions of known serial algorithms. Most of the algorithms discussed in this paper have been implemented on the Connection Machine, a highly parallel single instruction multiple data computer.}

abstract = {Manufacturing companies are struggling with the implementation of Circular Economy, especially due to the uncertainty regarding its potential sustainability benefits. In particular, and despite digital servitization is advocated by several studies as a way to achieve environmental gains, circular business models based on digital servitization are not always sustainable due to burden shifting and unexpected consequences which are difficult to assess before implementation. This is particularly relevant for the Electrical and Electronics Equipment industry, which suffers structural weaknesses such as the dependance on critical raw materials and an increasing waste generation. However, literature lacks models and tools able to address the complexity inherent in the systemic micro-macro perspective envisioned by Circular Economy, while studies that quantitatively assess the sustainability impacts and trade-offs of digital servitization-based circular scenarios are limited. This article aims to develop a better understanding of how the sustainability impacts of circular and servitized scenarios can be assessed and quantified at the economic, environmental, and social level, adopting a systemic perspective through the development of a what-if simulation model. The model is implemented in a spreadsheet tool and applied to a digital servitization-based Circular Economy scenario inspired by the case of a company offering long-lasting, high-efficient washing machines as-a-service. Results show that digital servitization can actually lead to a win-win-win situation with net positive effects to the environment, the society, and the economy. This result is based on the joint application of product design for digitalization and life extension, pay-per-use business models, and product reuse. These results are robust within a significant range of key parameters values. Practitioners and policymakers may use the model to support the evaluation of different circular and servitized scenarios before implementation.}

In this review paper, we draw upon ancient and modern literature on self-control along with contemporary ideas about the cognitive architecture supporting intentional action to argue that any computational account of moral agency must include an approach to self-control. In addition, we extract and develop a list of necessary features of the phenomena against which individual modeling efforts can be compared. The ARCADIA cognitive system will be discussed in light of this list of features and used to demonstrate both success and failure in a highly simplified self-control dilemma. Finally, we end by discussing a path toward more functionally complete models of agency and control, along with offering perfunctory thoughts on some of the more conceptually challenging issues to address in the future.}

To date, no computational method exists to systematically identify these critical phos-sites on kinases. In this study, we introduce PhoSiteformer, a transformer-inspired foundational model designed to generate embeddings of phos-sites using phosphorylation mass spectrometry data. Recognizing the complementary insights offered by protein sequence data and phosphorylation mass spectrometry data, we developed a classification model, CSPred, which employs a bimodal fusion strategy. CSPred combines embeddings from PhoSiteformer with those from the protein language model ProtT5. Our approach successfully identified 77 critical phos-sites on 58 human kinases. Two of these sites, T517 on PKG1 and T735 on PRKD3, have been experimentally verified. This study presents the first systematic and computational approach to identify critical phos-sites that enhance kinase activity.}

It is found that TRPG players score higher in divergent thinking tests. Priming and instruction giving methods lower the performance of all participants, in particular, when the instruction is memory provoking. ERPG players score lowest among the three groups. TRPG could be regarded as a form of improvisation. It could also be a preferable activity for the promotion of creativity. It is low cost and no formal setting is required to play. Many ERPGs are originated from TRPGs, therefore, with the popularity of ERPG, there should be advantages in promoting TRPG.}

Although some results have already been reported on generating ontologies from folksonomies, most of them do not consider what a more acceptable and applicable ontology for users should be, nor do they take human thinking into consideration. Cognitive psychologists find that most human knowledge is represented by basic level concepts which is a family of concepts frequently used by people in daily life. Taking cognitive psychology into consideration, we propose a method to generate ontologies with basic level concepts from folksonomies. Using Open Directory Project (ODP) as the benchmark, we demonstrate that the ontology generated by our method is reasonable and consistent with human thinking.}

However, when the market characteristics are much dynamic and change rapidly or the development project aims at a really new product, the levels of uncertainties are greater, and the project team must employ more robust strategies of risk management. Option thinking is useful to develop several concept alternatives of some crucial subsystems of the new product in order to achieve new technical and market knowledge by repeating cycles of design, built and tested by several and different prototypes in parallel. These different prototypes develop, test and can accumulate knowledge about each one, different technologies, architectures and quality attributes or the usability for potential customers. This study achieves the optimal number of concept options to develop in parallel in order to maximize the economic performance of the development project of a new product constituted of two important subsystems. Mathematical models simulating the sequential decision process are developed to determine the economic result and risk of a two-subsystem product innovation project. Our results point the parallel development of concept options as a robust strategy to manage new product development mostly in adverse conditions, that is, with greater levels of uncertainties.}

This chapter analyzes the results of some modern classical conditioning experiments from the perspective of a computational model based on the assumption that the underlying learning process is specifically adapted to the domain of multivariate, nonstationary time series. It focuses on the quantitative results from experiments on the effects of partial reinforcement on the rate of acquisition and extinction because the other predictions of the model have been discussed and associative models are conspicuously unsuccessful at making quantitative predictions in this area. The model gives a mathematical characterization of the learning process from which one can derive the results of conditioning experiments. It is unlike these models in the sense that it is not in the associative tradition. The model replaces the associative explanatory framework with a framework that treats the conditioning process as a computational mechanism adapted through evolution to the peculiarities of one domain-a mechanism that solves one and only one of the several fundamentally distinct learning problems that confront mobile, multicellular organisms.}

This chapter deals with analytical techniques that are used to probe the activity and chemical makeup of cells. Metabolomics, the study of the entire biochemical constituents of a cell at any one time, is found to provide a rich means of monitoring organism activity. It can reveal explanations for different characteristics of seemingly similar organisms and can be used to relate function with gene. Spectroscopies are well suited to the study and interpretation of the metabolome in functional genomics. Another important technique in functional genomics is the measurement of gene expression via transcriptome arrays. This chapter outlines the various ways in which evolutionary computation (EC) can provide the basis for powerful tools for spectral interpretation and thus for functional genomics. It mentions various methods of forming predictive models from multivariate, often quasi-continuous data. It also discusses ways in which the effectiveness of such conventional techniques may be enhanced by combining them with evolutionary techniques.}

This chapter provides an overview of the latest state of the art of methods for numerical computation of Nash equilibria —and refinements of Nash equilibria —for general finite n-person games. The appropriate method for computing Nash equilibria for a game depends on a number of factors. The first and most important factor involves, whether it is required to simply find one equilibrium (a sample equilibrium), or find all equilibria. The problem of finding one equilibrium is a well studied problem, and there exist number of different methods for numerically computing a sample equilibrium. The problem of finding all equilibria has been addressed recently. While, there exist methods for computation of all equilibria, they are computationally intensive. With current methods, they are only feasible on small problems. The chapter overviews methods for computing sample equilibria in normal form games, and discusses the computation of equilibria on extensive form games.}

We discuss how structural wiring patterns, global rhythms in deep structures, and electrochemical gain from neurotransmitters play a key role in the internal dynamics of what the brain is doing. Importantly, together, these elements dictate how the brain can or cannot obtain different brain states. Simultaneously, disruption in intrinsic structures and internal dynamics alters the energetic landscape causing some brain states to become more favorable or less favorable. Importantly, we go on to describe how landscapes arise from structural connectomes, and how these connections can dictate spontaneous behavioral patterns and tendencies in normal as well as pathologic states, such as a depressed patient being stuck in a self-ruminating and negative state. Resting-state fMRI also provides a keyhole into these processes as the entire set of the structural connectome creates the patterns of functional connectivity seen in resting-state brain activity.}

To that end, modern software needs to provide creative features to improve sustainability. To advance software creativity, research has proposed several techniques, including multi-day workshops involving experienced requirements analysts, and semi-automated tools to support creative thinking in a limited scope. Such approaches are either useful only for software with already rich issue tracking systems, or require substantial engagement from analysts with creative minds. In a recent work, we have demonstrated a novel framework that is beneficial for both novel and existing software and allows end-to-end automation promoting creativity. The framework reuses requirements from similar software freely available online, utilizes advanced natural language processing and machine learning techniques, and leverages the concept of requirement boilerplate to generate candidate creative requirements. An application of our framework on software domains: Antivirus, Web Browser, and File Sharing followed by a human subject evaluation have shown promising results. In this invited extension, we present further analysis for our research questions and report an additional evaluation by human subjects. The results exhibit the framework’s ability in generating creative features even for a relatively matured application domain, such as Web Browser, and provoking creative thinking among developers irrespective of their experience levels.}

We argue and illustrate that our empirically based knowledge of each of these four interconnected components has substantially advanced over the past decades, enabling a progressively better understanding of not only the components that constitute a mathematical disposition, but also the nature of the learning and developmental processes that should be induced in students to facilitate the acquisition of competence, the characteristics of learning environments that are powerful in initiating and evoking those processes, and finally, the kind of assessment instruments that are appropriate to help monitor and support learning and teaching.}

abstract = {With the rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT) technology in industrial, agricultural, medical and other fields, IoT terminal devices face security and privacy challenges when sharing data. Among them, ensuring data confidentiality, achieving dual-side privacy protection, and performing reliable data integrity verification are basic requirements. Especially in resource-constrained environments, limitations in the storage, computing, and communication capabilities of devices increase the difficulty of implementing these security safeguards. To address this problem, this paper proposes a resource-constrained anonymous data-sharing scheme (ADS-RC) for the IoT. In ADS-RC, we use elliptic curve operations to replace computation-intensive bilinear pairing operations, thereby reducing the computational and communication burden on end devices. We combine an anonymous verifiable algorithm and an attribute encryption algorithm to ensure double anonymity and data confidentiality during the data-sharing process. To deal with potential dishonest behavior, this solution supports the revocation of malicious user permissions. In addition, we designed a batch data integrity verification algorithm and stored verification evidence on the blockchain to ensure the security and traceability of data during transmission and storage. Through experimental verification, the ADS-RC scheme achieves reasonable efficiency in correctness, security and efficiency, providing a new solution for data sharing in resource-constrained IoT environments.}

Following a period of family interaction, members of normal families showed improvement in pattern recognition; members of families of schizophrenics showed deterioration or no change and members of character disorder families were in between. During the period of family interaction, members of normal families were independent and adventuresome in testing their pattern concepts whereas members of families of schizophrenics were cautios, copied each other's performance but showed little pooling of ideas. These findings support the hypothesis that family interaction can influence perceptual process in its individual members in a short time and points to some particular relationships between family interaction and individual perception.}

abstract = {The food sector in Qatar is confronted with formidable challenges due to its harsh environmental conditions. Striving for total food self-sufficiency in such an environment would inevitably exert pressure on the energy and water sectors. This heightened demand for energy and water translates into increased costs and escalates environmental impacts. Consequently, this study embarks on an in-depth analysis of food production within the context of Qatar's energy-water-food nexus, aiming to demonstrate how varying degrees of food self-sufficiency may impact the demand on Qatar's water and energy sectors, as well as on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Moreover, this study demonstrates to what extent specific subsystems within the nexus can be modified to enhance sustainability. An energy-water-food nexus is meticulously crafted within the proposed framework to elucidate the intricate interdependencies among these sectors, incorporating pertinent external variables. These interconnections are then transmuted into a system dynamics model (SDM), facilitating a nuanced exploration of potential transformations and their ripple effects. Furthermore, a life-cycle thinking approach explicitly tailored to Qatar was implemented to estimate GHG emissions accurately. Four distinct scenarios are rigorously examined using the SDM, spanning from a status quo perspective to ambitious transitions toward full food self-sufficiency. The findings of the scenarios indicate that scenario 4, which partially provides the country with its food demands locally using desalinated water, treated wastewater, and groundwater and satisfies 20 % of its energy demand from solar energy, is the most ideal with an annual 5.36 × 1010 kWh/year energy consumption, 1.73 × 1012 l/year water demand, and 3.26 × 1010 kg CO2 eq./year emissions. The outcomes underscore the imperative for prioritizing less energy-intensive resources to mitigate overall energy consumption. Additionally, achieving an optimal national scenario necessitates a judicious equilibrium between food imports and domestic production.}

This extensive online survey builds upon the findings of an earlier observational case study of the use of computer tools by a small engineering team. The case study was conducted during the conceptual and detailed stages of the design of a first-to-world product. Four mechanisms by which CAD tools may influence the creative problem solving process were investigated: enhanced visualisation and communication, circumscribed thinking, premature design fixation and bounded ideation. The prevalence of these mechanisms was examined via a series of questions that probed the user’s mode of working, attitudes, and responses to hypothetical situations. The survey showed good support for the first three mechanisms and moderate support for the fourth. The results have important implications for both the users and designers of CAD tools.}

There is a clear-cut rule for the operation to be performed at each step, as well as a clear-cut specification of the conditions under which to terminate the process. An algorithm may contain loops, that is, there may be steps that return to previous steps. Algorithms can be sequential or parallel.

abstract = {The oxidative functionalization of aromatic sp2 C–H bonds to C–O bonds is a difficult transformation. For main-group metals, the oxyfunctionalization step of a metal-aryl bond is generally slow and potentially problematic if carried out in a relatively strong acid solvent where protonation could prevent oxyfunctionalization. In this work, we experimentally and computationally analyzed the oxyfunctionalization reaction of (Ph)3BiV(TFA)2 (TFA = trifluoroacetate) in a trifluoroacetic acid (TFAH) solvent. Experiments showed a single oxyfunctionalization product phenyl TFA (PhTFA) and two equivalents of benzene. Explicit/continuum solvent density functional theory calculations revealed that a direct intramolecular reductive functionalization pathway is lower in energy than radical or ionic pathways, and surprisingly from (Ph)3BiV(TFA)2, the reductive functionalization pathway is potentially competitive with protonation. In contrast, for (Ph)2BiV(TFA)3 oxyfunctionalization is significantly lower in energy than protonation. For BiIII-phenyl intermediates, redox neutral protonation is significantly lower in energy than a second functionalization. We also examined the oxyfunctionalization versus protonation of BiV-phenyl complexes with a coordinated biphenyl ligand and a coordinated biphenyl sulfone ligand, which both resulted in oxyfunctionalization. For the biphenyl ligand complex, a protonation-first mechanism is proposed, while for the biphenyl sulfone ligand, an oxyfunctionalization first mechanism is consistent with both calculations and experiments.

While reviewing how Universe can be viewed as a computation, we find the need for Negative Universe (which is a part of the quantum vacuum mechanism). This idea is compared with Penrose’s current model which utilizes a separate Platonic world outside of physical Universe. Lastly, in the Discussion, I present an updated version of computational cosmography as a model for Universe as computation.}

abstract = {Throughout history, diverse Maths have underpinned numerous important natural and physical science discoveries. In their initial development and application, these Maths were often incompletely or imperfectly understood, with constants and “fudge factors” needed to account for statistical uncertainties to advance a scientific discipline. Some polymaths have acted as philosophers in support of new ways of thinking, based on their novel discoveries about the natural and physical world. Deep Maths integral to artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning and deep learning (DL), are also subject to human imperfections (i.e., computational errors, operator assumptions) and stochastic uncertainties (i.e., modeling biases, convergence optimizers). Mathematicians and domain experts can collaborate to increase AI model accuracy by improving training data quality (i.e., curating, reducing dimensionality), mitigating human and machine biases, and understanding data contexts prior to query. Since the advent of DL and through the design of multilayered feedforward neural networks then large language models, scientists have applied advanced AI computing capabilities to push the limits of this technology trend. Recently, AI's capacity to uncover newly modeled insights has been hyped beyond the proven limits of DL model accuracy. History has witnessed the acceptance of new knowledge (primarily by peers) based on the accuracy and/or reproducibility of empirical observations and on varied interpretations of mathematical proofs. Societal enthusiasm for science or technology insertion is often limited by the general public's understanding of the underlying Maths and Deep Maths, and related human fears and concerns of displacement (i.e., lost jobs, ecological impact, less privacy, etc.). Today's proponents of societal progress based on new discoveries and technologies are motivated by a range of influences (i.e., humanity, control, security, profit, etc.), creating additional uncertainties that can deflect initial scientific enthusiasm and/or delay widespread adoption.}

Before BCI could become a mainstream mode of HCI for CAD interfaces; fundamental studies directed towards understanding how humans mentally represent and process the geometry are needed. The outlined work in this paper presents an objective user study to understand shape recognition process in the humans. Specifically, we focus on the fundamental task of fragmentary shape identification. The problem of fragmentary shape recognition can be defined as follows: given a partial and incomplete minimalistic representation of a given shape, can one recognize the actual complete shape or object? In user studies, each subject was progressively (in stages) shown more informative fragmented images of an object to be recognized. During each stage of the experiment, the brain activity of users in the form of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals was recorded with a BCI headset. The recorded signals are then processed to objectively study the fragmentary shape recognition process. The results of user studies conclusively show that the measured brain activities of subjects can serve as a very accurate proxy to estimate subjects fragmentary shape recognition process.}

We conducted a systematic literature search and included 30 meta-analyses, reporting correlations between mathematics achievement and 66 variables based on 13,853 effect sizes and an estimated 4,658,717 participants. The correlations are rank-ordered by size and complemented with information about the meta-analyses, their inclusion criteria, and methods.

In particular, we propose to address the lack of terminological resources related to suicide by a method of constructing a vocabulary associated with suicide. We then propose, for a better analysis, to investigate Weka as a tool of data mining based on machine learning algorithms that can extract useful information from Twitter data collected by Twitter4J. Therefore, an algorithm of computing semantic analysis between tweets in training set and tweets in data set based on WordNet is proposed. Experimental results demonstrate that our method based on machine learning algorithms and semantic sentiment analysis can extract predictions of suicidal ideation using Twitter Data. In addition, this work verify the effectiveness of performance in term of accuracy and precision on semantic sentiment analysis that could thinking of suicide.}
