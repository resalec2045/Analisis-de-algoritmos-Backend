abstract = {This paper reports on a multi-semester study of the impact on student perceptions of their computational thinking abilities as a result of collaboration between students in computer science (CS) and journalism courses to solve a problem for a community partner, Habitat for Humanity. Interdisciplinary computing collaborations have become a popular mode of instruction in upper-level CS courses. In many cases, these collaborations have been with other STEM disciplines. However, there are non-STEM fields that have been transformed by computer science and can also serve as fruitful test beds for curricular innovation; journalism is one such field. In this study, undergraduate students in CS and journalism courses focused on creating a computational solution to address a real community need. The study investigates whether immersion in multidisciplinary collaborative experiences increases the computational thinking abilities of both CS and non-CS students. 41 CS students participated in the study alongside 96 students in a range of other STEM and non-STEM majors. Quantitative data were collected to gauge students' attainment of concepts and skills constitutive to computational thinking. Pre-test data indicate that CS students were no different from other STEM students in their own assessment of computational thinking and skills. Post-test data indicate that while all students made significant gains in self-assessment of skills and knowledge, CS majors fared significantly better than their peers. It is particularly noteworthy that CS majors' gains outpaced those of computer engineering majors. Further research is planned to gain additional insight into the possible reasons behind these results.},

abstract = {This paper describes the design and initial assessment of a general education course in computational thinking for non-computer science majors. The key elements of the course include multidisciplinary cohorts to achieve learning across contexts, multiple languages/tools, including block-based and textual programming languages, repeated exposure to the underlying computational ideas in different forms, and student-defined projects using real world ("big") data to heighten motivation through self-directed contextualized learning. The preliminary multi-methods assessment shows that the course engendered high levels of motivation, achieved key objectives for learning in and across contexts, largely affirmed the choice of languages/tools, and supported, though less strongly than anticipated, the motivational effects of real-world data},

abstract = {End-user game design tools are effective in motivating and exposing students with no prior programming experience to computer science. However, while there is good evidence that these environments are effective motivators, the question remains what do students actually learn? For our purposes, using AgentSheets, we would like to know if students can apply the knowledge obtained from programming games to creating science simulations. Specifically, we want to better understand if students are able to recognize Computational Thinking Patterns (CTP) from their game programming experience. Computational Thinking Patterns are abstract programming patterns that enable agent interactions not only in games but also in science simulations. Students and teachers who participated in a game design summer institute were administered a Computational Thinking Pattern Quiz (CTP Quiz). This quiz tested the participants' ability to recognize and understand patterns in a context removed from game programming. We found that participants, for the most part, were able to understand and recognize the patterns in a variety of contexts},

Big data is considered difficult to use because of its inherent technical obstacles. To overcome these difficulties, I introduce a new project: CORGIS - a "Collection of Real-time, Giant, Interesting, Situated Datasets". The CORGIS project comprises a collection of libraries that provide an interface to big data for students, architectures for rapidly enabling new datasets, and a web-based textbook platform for disseminating relevant course materials. This textbook features an online block-based programming environment, real-time collaborative text editing, and continuous server-side storage.

abstract = {Computational Thinking (CT) is beginning to be accepted as one of the fundamental 21st century skills for everyone. Curricula and environments are being developed for different group ages, from kindergarten to university, in several countries. As part of this global tendency, France has recently taken political decisions to integrate CT Education (CTE) in the mandatory national curriculum. However, many challenges remain until a full implementation is achieved. In this paper we report on a partnership between a university, local elementary schools and the county Ministry of Education (MoE), and on an exploratory project of introducing CT to K-5 students. This project has provided us with valuable feedback on the specifics of integrating CT in a national curriculum and the creation of a partnership and a community. These lessons will be used in the following stage of scaling up to more elementary schools in the entire county, but also addressing other school levels such as kindergarten, middle school and high school.},

This workshop provides hands-on practice with Lexos [1], a web-based workflow for entry-level text processing, statistical analysis, and visualization of results when exploring digitized texts. Funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH), Lexos reflects six years of software development with undergraduates in a model that blends a start-up company with interdisciplinary research. In addition to hands-on play, participants will be introduced to course materials used in our "Computing for Poets" course as well as share in discussions of effective practices for outreach to the digital humanities on their campuses. More information on our successful use in the classroom and in our own research is available at our website [2]. The software for Lexos is available on our GitHub repo [3].},

abstract = {Computational Thinking (CT) has gained in popularity in recent years, both within educational and political discourses. It is more than ever important to discuss the term itself in order to determine to which extent it is helpful in solving the challenges it has been suggested to address. Recently, Denning (2017) proposed that CT can be viewed as either "traditional" or "new". Traditional CT is a skillset resulting from engaging in traditional computing activities, e.g. programming, whereas new CT forefronts certain skills as desired in problem solving. By looking at CT through the perspective of computer semiotics, specifically the algorithmic sign, it is possible to dissolve the hard distinction of traditional vs. new. Instead, a perception of CT having both an implicit and an explicit nature emerges, allowing for a dialectic relationship between CT's integrated implicit and explicit nature.},

To address these concerns, we have developed a computational thinking framework to be used as a planning and evaluative tool. Within this framework, we aim to unify the differing opinions about what computational thinking should involve. As a case study, we have applied the framework to Light-Bot, an educational game with a strong focus on programming, and found that the framework provides us with insight into the usefulness of the game to reinforce computer science concepts.},

Finally, a proof-of-concept prototype, corresponding to the implementation of the method, is highlighted.},

abstract = {Alternate Reality Games (ARGs) can be utilized as an educational platform to engage students in a collaborative exploration of the field of computing as a means to increase interest in computing. This paper will review the use of ARGs for educational purposes, the educational value of using ARGS, and how ARGs can be designed for re-use. My research is focused on exploring the use of ARGS as component of a computing education framework.},
