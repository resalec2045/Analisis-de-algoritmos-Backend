abstract = {Computational thinking and coding-based problem solving are increasingly seen as crucial cross-disciplinary skills and an important part of a well-rounded education. Coding games and problem solving exercises have been growing in popularity. Many large-scale initiatives have been launched in order to bring these initiatives into classrooms, from preschool to secondary education. CodyColor is a simplified coding game, which takes basic programming instructions representing movements ("turn left" and "turn right") and represents them with color blocks. In contrast to most other coding games, color-coded programming relies on no symbolic interpretation on part of the player in order to be approachable by very young players as well. We present a massively multiplayer online version of CodyColor, discuss design and implementation specifics, and enumerate some of the possible game modes.},

abstract = {This paper describes a learning activity on computational thinking in Ethics classroom with compulsory secondary school students (14-16 years). It is based on the assumption that computational thinking (or better "logical thinking") is applicable not only to STEM subjects but to any other field in education, and it is particularly suited to decision making in moral dilemmas. This will be carried out through the study of so called "moral machines", using a game-based learning approach on self-driving vehicles and the need to program such cars to perform certain behaviours under extreme situations. Students will be asked to logically base their reasoning on different ethical approaches and try to develop a schema of decision making that could serve to program a machine to respond to those situations. Students will have to deal also with the uncertainty of reaching solutions that will be debatable and not universally accepted as part of de difficulty, more ethical than technical, to provide machines with the ability to take decisions where there is no such thing as a "right" versus "wrong" answer, and potentially both (or more) of the possible actions will bring unwanted consequences.},

We report on the development of a human labeling system for gameplay evidence of four CT skills: problem decomposition, pattern recognition, algorithmic thinking, and abstraction. We define labels that identify use of these skills in three Zoombinis puzzles, based on analysis of video data from both CT novices (upper elementary and middle school students) and CT experts (computer scientists and expert Zoombinis players). Future work will involve the construction of detectors for implicit CT skills based on these human labels, in order to analyze gamelog data at scale and give feedback to teachers.},

abstract = {Although educators, researchers, and designers have increasingly advocated for developing computational thinking (CT) in young children, the vast majority of CT learning environments fail to support the development of positive attitudes towards problem solving, confidence in dealing with complexity, and communicating and working with others to achieve a goal. To address this issue, our design team developed a music-based puzzle game called SynthSync. The game challenges players to work collaboratively to "debug" jumbled musical compositions through close listening, tinkering, and communication. SynthSync players manipulate controls to adjust musical variables (pitch, note length, and the length of rests) in arhythmic and dissonant musical puzzles based on popular songs until they "discover" the original piece of music.},

abstract = {This study examined how computational thinking (CT) has been used to teach problem-solving skills and programming education in the recent past. This study specifically (i) identified articles that discussed CT approach for programming education at higher education institutions (HEIs), (ii) classified the different CT approaches and tools employed for programming education at HEIs, (iii) synthesised and discussed results that are reported by relevant studies that utilized CT for teaching programming at HEIs. A systematic literature review methodology was adopted in this study. Out of 161 articles retrieved, 33 of them that met the inclusion criteria were reviewed. Our study revealed that the use of CT at HEIs for programming education began in 2010; many studies did not specify the context of use, but the use of CT is found to be gaining grounds in many contexts, especially the developed countries; course design approach was mostly employed by educators to introduce CT at HEIs for programming education. Furthermore, this study pointed out how CT approach can be explored for designing a smart learning environment to support students in learning computer programming.},

It draws concepts and techniques such as abstraction, decomposition, algorithmic design, generalization, evaluation and iteration from computer and information science, but has broad application in the arts, sciences, humanities and social sciences. This paper compares computational and critical modes of thinking, identifying concepts and terminology that support cross-disciplinary discourse, inform faculty and curriculum development efforts, and interconnect learning outcomes at the course, program and university level, thus helping programs better articulate contributions to institutional goals. A better understanding of each mode can enrich what we teach aspiring information professionals about computational and critical thinking, how we teach it, and how we apply these skills in our professional work.},

It is sometimes hard for a computer scientist to imagine how people without access to those tools can navigate the world in an informed way.We have designed a course to bring the social, historical, cultural and technical context of these systems to the attention of students and citizens who would not otherwise have access to them, so they can better understand the world in which they will live and work. The course is a Computer Science course because it is talking about the science of computers, albeit in an approachable form for an audience without any assumed previous programming experience.The course ran in Winter 2014 and Winter 2015 meeting most of its goals, including engaging the non-traditional student who took it.},

Therefore, it is very important to evaluate the effectiveness of computational thinking in the elementary computer courses.

In this paper, we investigate the teaching effectiveness for achieve accurate data and decision support on the computational-thinking-oriented computer curriculum reform. Our research is based on recent evaluations and data acquisition. We analyze the test database, categories of questions, and scores of students. We find several problems, such as the over-emphasizing the programming, incomplete knowledge components, limited background, large deviation of evaluation results among universities. Finally, we give several improvement recommendations.},

It is based on an empirical study in which 28 Swedish third-grade school children (9-10 years of age) participated in a creative workshop where they were challenged to design a digital game using stop-motion film technique, working in groups. The study applies a designerly approach to game design activities to investigate what aspects of computational skills can be identified when children employ stop motion filmmaking as a means to envision a digital game design idea and how a designerly approach can enable them to enact dimensions of their computational skills? The data included video observations, casual conversations, and stop-motion videos representing the children's game design ideas. The analysis identified three aspects of computational thinking strategies while children produced stop-motion films: step-by-step procedural skills; design and arrangement skills; and computational perspectives.},
