abstract = {This study is a digital form-finding and manual fabrication experiment in woven architectural design, with one traditional weaving style, Kagome, used to scale the craft up into an architectural-scale bamboo woven artifact. Kagome is a trihexagonal pattern employed in traditional bamboo basketry as a triaxial weaving system, resulting in an object with a self-bracing capacity without the use of fasteners owing to its interlacing lattices. Although existing studies and tools have addressed triaxial weaving design and representation, the current consideration of the advantages of weaving with bamboo is insufficient. To address this research gap, this study develops a computational design method based on studies on bamboo basketry. This allows for the representation and exploration of design geometries using combinations of regular triangular meshes for the fabrication of Kagome woven bamboo artifacts. A full-scale mock-up was fabricated to evaluate the effectiveness of the method. The mock-up demonstrated the self-bracing properties of Kagome, but there were discrepancies between the mock-up and the design. Factors affecting bamboo weaving on an architectural scale have been identified within this study to inform future research on woven bamboo structures.}

abstract = {Patrick Geddes articulated the growth and design of cities in the early years of the town planning movement in Britain using biological principles of which Darwin’s (1859) theory of evolution was central. His ideas about social evolution, the design of local communities, and his repeated calls for comprehensive understanding through regional survey and plan laid the groundwork for much practical planning in the mid 20th century, both with respect to an embryonic theory of cities and the practice of planning. But Geddes had a much wider agenda that town planning per se. He sought after a philosophy of life that went well beyond Darwinism verging almost on the spiritual at times. Yet his personal approach and the limits he imposed on his formal thinking meant that he was never able to establish his big picture in a way that later generations could easily grasp and build upon. He left us with enticing ideas, evocative phrases, and a practical philosophy of doing planning and building communities that has indeed survived as something more than a footnote in history. In this essay, we identify the key paradox of modern planning which seeks to intervene in systems that have enormous complexity, growing and evolving rather than being designed in any top-down fashion. We illustrate this paradox through Geddes’ own career and life in which this tension between bottom up and top down was always to the forefront. We then sketch his influence on practicing planners and key intellectuals of the mid to late 20th century—Abercrombie and Mumford, Jacobs and Alexander. We bring this history of Geddes’ influence up to contemporary times when the complexity sciences with all their focus on evolving systems, now permeate our thinking, suggesting various ways in which we might examine the history of the planning in the last 100 years in a new light through the lens of Geddes’ arguments and principles}

This neuroconstructivism (the notion that neural functions are shaped by these interactions) is core to some developmental theories. However, due to their complexity, understanding underlying developmental mechanisms is challenging. Elsewhere in neurobiology, a computational revolution has shown that mathematical models of hidden biological mechanisms can bridge observations with theory building. Can we build a similar computational framework yielding mechanistic insights for brain development? Here, we outline the conceptual and technical challenges of addressing this theory gap, and demonstrate that there is great potential in specifying brain development as mathematically defined processes operating within physical constraints. We provide examples, alongside broader ingredients needed, as the field explores computational explanations of system-wide development.}

Findings reveal that laypersons are the dominant communicators in terms of discussion volume, who often focus on relevant news events, societal or political aspects of TCM. In contrast, professionals keep concentrating on issues related to medical expertise, and do not shift attentions as frequent as laypersons. Despite the dominant influence of professionals on laypersons’ agenda, two-way agenda interactions identified confirm that lay public is empowered to negotiate with elite professionals under certain topics. Our results provide novel insights into the dynamic nature of attentions, behaviors, and relations among prominent communication actors, and encourage future research to examine the individual-level and societal-level impacts of these constructs in the emerging online media landscape.}

We develop the GRALB model, which is based on Role-Based Collaboration (RBC) in cooperative services, to comprehensively manage the offloading strategy of terminal user tasks between edge nodes and the cloud to solve the joint communication and computing resource allocation problem in intelligent manufacturing systems. First, we jointly model the end-to-end latency and energy consumption based on the physical scenario of cloud-edge collaboration. Then, we extend the GRA model based on E-CARGO and propose the GRALB model with load balancing, which formally models the original joint communication and computing resource allocation problem as an equivalent cooperative service model and provides a proof of algorithm convergence. Finally, we design an x-ILP solution to support the verification and integrated application of the proposed model. Simulation results further confirm our theoretical analysis and show that the proposed collaborative cloud and edge computing solution significantly improves the overall system performance.}

Constructal law is the thermodynamic theory based on the analysis of fluxes across the boundaries of an open system. Protocells, as dynamic, autopoietic and adaptive open finite size systems, serve in this paper as a compelling metaphor and design model for responsive and sustainable manmade architectural and urban environments. The ability of protocells to harness energy, minimize entropy, and adapt to environmental changes mirrors the principles of constructal thermodynamics, which govern the flow and distribution of resources in complex self-organizing information open systems in nature. By applying these principles to digital architecture, this study investigates how relational dynamics between spaces, materials, and functions can create adaptive designs that “go with the flow” of ecological and cultural systems. The research demonstrates using the Gouy-Stodola theorem as a variational principle, how protocell-inspired processes facilitate exergy-efficient designs, minimizing waste while maximizing resilience and flexibility. The present paper argues -through an applied case study- for a paradigm where protocell digital architecture serves not only as an ecological and material model but mainly as a spatial narrative driver, blending constructal and digital tools with cultural mythos. Finally, this paper exploring simultaneously the semantic complexity and ontology of such systems, in turn, connects these constructal driven digital designs to broader poly-narratives, embedding cultural, symbolic, philosophical and functional predicates into architectural forms.}

In addition, a nonlinear approach to consider friction losses in the modeling is introduced. The modeling is described by Mixed-Integer Linear (MILP) and Integer Nonlinear (MINLP) Programming models. The optimal solutions are provided by Outer Approximation (OA), Branch-and-Bound (BB), and Interior Point algorithms. The simulations show that the water is managed distinctly depending on the optimizer and solution algorithms. Finally, the findings of the spillage policy obtained by the Mixed-Integer Nonlinear model under the cubic function for power generation encourage and indicate its adequacy for a more realistic operation and management of the Mexican Hydro-Power Plant water resources.}

In Experiment 1 (N=39), children’s performance improved on both conditional and syllogism tasks when they responded with an arrow rather than pointing with a finger. In Experiment 2 (N=42), 3- and 4-year-olds benefited from both an arrow manipulation and, separately, the introduction of a delay before responding. We suggest that both manipulations help children to overcome an impulsive prepotent response to counterfactual questions arising from a default assumption that information about the past is true.}

In this method analytes are propelled by an external applied voltage towards the sensor until they are trapped at the DNH-ssNP interface via a self-induced back action (SIBA) plasmonic force. We have previously named this method SIBA Actuated Nanopore Electrophoresis (SANE) sensing and have shown its ability to perform concurrent optical and DC electrical measurements. Here, we extend this method to AC sensing of 20 nm SiO2 (silica) nanoparticles, using voltage modulation over a wide range of frequencies applied on top of a baseline DC bias. The sensor was constructed using two-beam GFIS Focused Ion Beam (FIB) lithography, incorporating Ne FIB to mill the DNH and He FIB to drill a central 30 nm ssNP. We utilized COMSOL Multiphysics simulations to explore the multi-frequency AC current conductance properties of the silica nanoparticles trapped at the SANE sensor. These simulations computed conductance changes and phase shifts induced by the presence of the nanoparticle over an AC frequency range of 20 Hz to 100 kHz. Experimental measurements confirmed the trends seen in the computational data. Additional computational studies were then performed to dissect the underlying mechanisms driving the observed AC measurements. Looking forward, we aim to adapt this technology for probing therapeutic nanoparticles non-invasively, offering a promising tool for enhancing quality control of nanoparticle-mediated drug and gene delivery systems.}

abstract = {This paper intends to join the long-standing debate regarding thinking styles and personality traits—should thinking styles be measured in addition to the measurement of personality traits? The means to achieve this goal was to provide empirical evidence as well as to review other studies in the literature. The Thinking Styles Inventory and the NEO Five-Factor Inventory were administered to 267 (67 male and 200 female) students from a large research university in Beijing, People's Republic of China. Results showed that thinking styles and personality traits statistically overlap. However, this overlap is limited. Two major arguments are made. First, thinking styles make a unique contribution to the understanding of human individual differences. Second, the necessity for measuring thinking styles apart from measuring personality traits depends on who uses the inventories and for what purposes.}

Internally generated (‘detached’) cognition may have evolved in part because of its contributions to this broad function, but important questions remain about its role in threat management. In this article, we therefore present a taxonomy of threat-related internally generated cognition comprising episodic and semantic formats of memory and prospection. We address the proximate mechanisms of each of the capacities in this taxonomy, and discuss their respective contributions to adaptive threat management in humans. For instance, mental time travel empowers people to contemplate and learn from threats experienced long ago, as well as to plan for dangers that might arise in the distant future. However, despite their functional benefits, these thought processes are also central to contemporary anxiety disorders and may be a potent source of distress.}

The global pandemic and the immediate switch to remote instruction forced instructors to reconsider how they can use computation to teach concepts previously approached with other instructional methods. In this review, we survey some of the curricula, materials, and resources for instructors who want to include theory, simulation, and computation in the undergraduate curriculum. There has been a notable progression from teaching students to use discipline-specific computational tools to developing interactive computational tools that promote active learning to having students write code themselves, such that they view computation as another tool for solving problems. We are moving toward a future where computational skills, including programming, data analysis, visualization, and simulation, will no longer be considered an optional bonus for students but a required skill for the 21st century STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) workforce; therefore, all physical and life science students should learn to program in the undergraduate curriculum.}

abstract = {The momentary, global functional state of the brain is reflected by its electric field configuration. Cluster analytical approaches consistently extracted four head-surface brain electric field configurations that optimally explain the variance of their changes across time in spontaneous EEG recordings. These four configurations are referred to as EEG microstate classes A, B, C, and D and have been associated with verbal/phonological, visual, subjective interoceptive–autonomic processing, and attention reorientation, respectively. The present study tested these associations via an intra-individual and inter-individual analysis approach. The intra-individual approach tested the effect of task-induced increased modality-specific processing on EEG microstate parameters. The inter-individual approach tested the effect of personal modality-specific parameters on EEG microstate parameters. We obtained multichannel EEG from 61 healthy, right-handed, male students during four eyes-closed conditions: object-visualization, spatial-visualization, verbalization (6 runs each), and resting (7 runs). After each run, we assessed participants' degrees of object-visual, spatial-visual, and verbal thinking using subjective reports. Before and after the recording, we assessed modality-specific cognitive abilities and styles using nine cognitive tests and two questionnaires. The EEG of all participants, conditions, and runs was clustered into four classes of EEG microstates (A, B, C, and D). RMANOVAs, ANOVAs and post-hoc paired t-tests compared microstate parameters between conditions. TANOVAs compared microstate class topographies between conditions. Differences were localized using eLORETA. Pearson correlations assessed interrelationships between personal modality-specific parameters and EEG microstate parameters during no-task resting. As hypothesized, verbal as opposed to visual conditions consistently affected the duration, occurrence, and coverage of microstate classes A and B. Contrary to associations suggested by previous reports, parameters were increased for class A during visualization, and class B during verbalization. In line with previous reports, microstate D parameters were increased during no-task resting compared to the three internal, goal-directed tasks. Topographic differences between conditions included particular sub-regions of components of the metabolic default mode network. Modality-specific personal parameters did not consistently correlate with microstate parameters except verbal cognitive style which correlated negatively with microstate class A duration and positively with class C occurrence. This is the first study that aimed to induce EEG microstate class parameter changes based on their hypothesized functional significance. Beyond the associations of microstate classes A and B with visual and verbal processing, respectively, our results suggest that a finely-tuned interplay between all four EEG microstate classes is necessary for the continuous formation of visual and verbal thoughts. Our results point to the possibility that the EEG microstate classes may represent the head-surface measured activity of intra-cortical sources primarily exhibiting inhibitory functions. However, additional studies are needed to verify and elaborate on this hypothesis.}

The beginning of computational intelligence has revolutionized the diagnostic landscape, offering promising ways for early and accurate detection of these debilitating conditions. Machine learning algorithms, a subset of computational intelligence, have emerged as powerful tools for analyzing extensive datasets comprising genetic, imaging, and clinical information. Furthermore, computational intelligence facilitates the integration of multimodal data, integrating information from genetic profiles, brain imaging (MRI, PET scans), and clinical assessments. This consolidative approach enables a comprehensive understanding of disease progression and aids in the development of predictive models for early medical assessment and prediction of the outcome. Moreover, the utilization of computational intelligence in neuroimaging analysis has shown remarkable potential. Advanced image processing techniques coupled with machine learning algorithms enable the detection of structural and functional abnormalities in the brain, often serving as precursors to neurodegenerative disorders. This chapter explores the key role of computational intelligence in enhancing the diagnosis of neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer, Parkinson, etc. In conclusion, computational intelligence offers a transformative framework for advancing the diagnosis of neurodegenerative disorders. Embracing and refining these computational tools will undoubtedly overlay the way for more effective interventions and personalized medicine in the fight against these challenging conditions.}

Specifically, the model simulates students' cognition as they complete activities within a science classroom. This study also seeks to examine the effects, as evidenced in the ANN, of an intervention designed to develop increased levels of critical thinking related to science skills. This model is based on the identification of cognitive attributes and integration of two advanced measurement frameworks: cognitive diagnostics and Item Response Theory. Both frameworks examine student response patterns, providing initial inputs for the ANN portion of the model. Once initial task response patterns are identified, they are parameterized and presented to the ANN. The ANN within this study is the foundational component of a computational model based upon the interaction of multiple, connected, adaptive processing elements know as cognitive attributes. These cognitive attributes process student responses to cognitive tasks within science tasks. Using the Student Task and Cognition Model (STAC-M), the study authors simulated a cognitive training intervention using a randomized control trial design of 100,000 students. Results of the simulation suggest that it is possible to increase levels of student success using a targeted cognitive attribute approach and that computational modeling provides a means to test educational theory for future education research. The paper also discusses limitations of the use of this computational model within education and the possible future directions for educators and researchers.}

Radical connectionism claims that cognition never implicates an internal symbolic medium, not even when natural language plays a part in our thought processes. On the face of it, such a position renders the human capacity for abstract thought quite mysterious. However, we argue that connectionism is committed to an analog conception of neural computation, and that representation of the abstract is no more problematic for a system of analog vehicles than for a symbol system. Natural language is therefore not required as a representational medium for abstract thought. Since natural language is arguably not a representational medium at all, but a conventionally governed scheme of communicative signals, we suggest that the role of internalised (i.e. self-directed) language is best conceived in terms of the coordination and control of cognitive activities within the brain.}

However, recent findings suggest that there can also be a positive correlation between cognitive capacity and correct intuitive thinking. Here we present results from 2 studies that directly contrasted whether cognitive capacity is more predictive of having correct intuitions or successful deliberate correction of an incorrect intuition. We used a two-response paradigm in which people were required to give a fast intuitive response under time pressure and cognitive load and afterwards were given the time to deliberate. We used a direction-of change analysis to check whether correct responses were generated intuitively or whether they resulted from deliberate correction (i.e., an initial incorrect-to-correct final response change). Results showed that although cognitive capacity was associated with the correction tendency (overall r = 0.22) it primarily predicted correct intuitive responding (overall r = 0.44). These findings force us to rethink the nature of sound reasoning and the role of cognitive capacity in reasoning. Rather than being good at deliberately correcting erroneous intuitions, smart reasoners simply seem to have more accurate intuitions.}

Thirty-six participants with OCD, 36 matched healthy controls and 36 participants with major depressive disorder (MDD) learned under proactive interference in three study conditions: single-task condition, condition with heightened cognitive self-consciousness and condition with an external secondary task. Memory was impaired in the cognitive self-consciousness condition compared to both other conditions.

This is achieved by two-way coupling the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) code OpenFOAM and the Computational Thermodynamics (CT) code Thermochimica, using the Joint Research Centre Molten Salt Database (JRCMSD). Local chemical equilibrium is assumed, implying that chemical kinetics are predominantly governed by mass transport. Four simulations address normal operating conditions, exploring: (i) dilution of fission products injected within the molten salt coolant, (ii) molten salt coolant evaporation rate, (iii) release of radioactive gaseous species, (iv) shifts in the UF4/UF3 ratio, and (v) comparison of vapour pressures of gaseous species. The influence of temperature-dependent viscosity on retaining fission products, compared to consistent values, is also discussed. The feasibility of integrating CFD with Thermochimica showed promising results, broadening insights into multiphysics systems and setting the stage for its application in more intricate scenarios.}

abstract = {Resource allocation decisions require information about individuals' preferences for goods and services. Survey based stated preference methods, such as discrete choice experiments (DCEs), are used to elicit preferences for non-market goods. A critique of stated preference research is that respondents to hypothetical surveys may not provide careful and thoughtful responses that reveal rational preferences. Choice certainty has been used to measure survey respondents' task engagement. Researchers assume that respondents who are certain about their choices provide deliberative responses. In the case of DCE, we argue that the variability of choice certainty is also important. We present a novel framework to identify thoughtful / deliberative respondents. The framework combines respondents’ certainty with their variability in certainty across a set of choice tasks. We test our framework empirically using data from two case studies. We find respondents with higher mean certainty and variability (i) seldom use decision heuristics, (ii) are more likely to have monotonic preferences, (iii) have longer response times, (iv) make choices that have higher interval validity, and (v) have higher choice consistency. We discuss the relevance of alternative ex-post calibration strategies with a view to improve the precision and accuracy of DCE-based welfare estimates.}

This article proposes a radically different approach based on the observation that we live in a world that is more complex than our minds/brains possess the ability to process in its entirety. Our limited equipment forces us to deal with only selected aspects of any given piece of that complex world at each instant. Selection—be it conscious or unconscious—involves agency and choice. Design and design thinking scholars have much to say about how agency and choice can be impacted by still other choices—context, symbols, movement, audience, and so on. Suppose cognition and meaning making were re-cast as design processes? This would highlight the role played by cybernetics—the science of how we learn how to steer—in shaping how we cognitively deal with the world. Together design and cybernetics have much to offer the cognitive sciences.}

abstract = {Presently, computational intelligence plays a major role in the areas of artificial intelligence–based neural network, fuzzy network and natural language processing, diligence-based games cognitive developmental computing, genetic algorithm, deep and machine learning, evolutionary computing under sustainable computing, and optimization methods. Several uncertainties raised in multivariant complexity for mathematical-based computational reasoning cannot be converted in machine language, which can be understood by computer. But the computational intelligence gives various solutions for many issues in real-world problems. The uncertainty fuzziness issues could be solved through computational artificial intelligence–based neural networks, which understand the real world as well as experimental facts through biological and evolutionary computing and machine learning with probabilistic methods. Swarm-based artificial intelligence and intelligent robotic immune systems is also an integral part of computational intelligence in sustainable computing. Presently, computational-based intelligence-based various fuzzy logic concepts has been enforced through fuzzifier and de-fuzzifier with assistance of crisp sets in automated control-based aerospace engineering, cooperative business with suitable logical decision-making, highly productive-based industrial engineering process, efficient automotive traffic control, and other real-time environment. Computational intelligence enforced the fuzzy semantics with mathematics ideas are implemented in advanced trading models, which assist the data analysts to make computerized automated artificial intelligence–based machine learning buy and sell signals. To sustain the artificial-intelligence applications by various categories of different types of artificial intelligence neural network like forward, convolutional, modular, and radial basis. Computational intelligence involved evolutionary intelligence techniques and algorithm enforce a collection of families of population-based experimental and error issues with solvers using a metaheuristic algorithm. Evolutionary intelligence algorithms invoke biological neural network operations such as computational reproduction, automated mutation, neural network-based natural selection, and evaluation of fitness in real entities. Computational intelligence in sustainable computing enforces artificial intelligence evolutionary computational system includes finite deterministic automata, a simplification of computerized-Turing machines, context-free-grammars enable to inspect the features of biological-based artificial intelligence neural network. Swarm intelligence applies swarm robotics, which govern and implement swarm principles and rules to automated robots through set artificial intelligence–based algorithms, which solved weather forecasting issues. Swarm robotics with genetically revised organisms applied in synthetic cooperative artificial intelligence, natural systems such as hawks hunting, bacterial growth. Artificial intelligence immune systems are one of the computational intelligence in sustainable computing, which adopts theoretically and practical based immunological and biology concepts and its functions, ideologies, and methods, which has been implemented in a fertile ground for encouragement and DNA computing. Sustainable computing makes use of well-organized physical equipment's and logical program, the dropping of electronic waste, the execution of supportable practices in management data center operations, and also reduced the negative impact on the environment caused by the fast growth of knowledge and increasing demand for computing power. Computational sustainable artificial-intelligence applied in social, environmental, and technological resources for the upcoming well-being of various civilizations through different from computer science, mathematics, and various fields. Optimization techniques are a controlling combination of methods and tools for solving complex real-world problems in different areas of optimization like linear programming optimization, intelligent-based meta-heuristics, nature-inspired optimization and applications. Optimizing the software can be achieved through virtualization, terminal servers and allocating resources strategically.

Neuroimaging research so far has focused on episodic prospection, or thinking about hypothetical future personal events. What has received no attention is semantic prospection or contemplating hypothetical future world events. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we show a number of functional dissociations in the brain when comparing future and past thinking across personal and non-personal conceptual domains. In the prefrontal cortex, the processes of information integration and self-referential thinking in the anterior medial prefrontal cortex were differentiated from those pertaining to generative construction along the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex and adjoining regions in the superior frontal gyrus. Dorsal parts of the lateral inferior parietal lobe showed lateralization effects as a function of the divergent or convergent nature of the retrieval process corresponding to whether the accessed information referred to hypothetical or real events. While ventral parts of the bilateral inferior parietal lobe were preferentially engaged during both personal past and personal future thinking, dissociations between the areas involved in personal past versus personal future thinking were found along the medial parietal wall. All in all, these findings provide novel and critical insights into the complex interactions between different processes involved in prospective and retrospective thought as modulated by the type of processed content.}

abstract = {Relational reasoning (RR) and divergent thinking (DT) are two critical antecedents of creative problem solving, but the relation between them is not currently well understood psychologically, limiting efforts to support these constructs through education. The threshold hypothesis (TH) is currently the dominant explanation for the relation between RR and DT, and posits that RR fundamentally supports DT, but only up to a point. In this study, quantile regression was used to test the TH among RR and two separate dimensions of DT: originality and fluency. Results generally supported the TH in regards to originality, with RR being significantly positively related to originality, but only in students at or below the median of the originality distribution. However, the TH was not upheld for fluency, which was only significantly predicted by RR at the top (i.e. 9th decile) of the fluency distribution. In general, results suggest that direct instructional intervention of RR strategies may be most supportive of creativity for those students who are simultaneously highly fluent but low-original thinkers.}

Despite the proliferation of intelligent systems and Web-based applications, the ethical and legal nuances of these technologies have become increasingly significant. The review follows a structured methodology, assessing 92 primary studies through sixteen research questions covering demographics, application scenarios, user requirements, objectives, functionalities, technologies, advantages, limitations, proposed solutions, ethical and legal implications, and the role of explainable AI (XAI). The findings indicate that while CPT holds promise in inducing behavioral change, many prototypes remain untested on a large scale (60% of surveyed studies only developed at a conceptual level), and long-term effectiveness is still uncertain (36% report attaining their goals, but none focuses on long-term assessment). The study highlights the need for more comparative analyses of persuasion models and tailored approaches to meet diverse user needs. Ethical and legal concerns, such as patient consent, data privacy, and potential for users’ manipulation, are under-explored and require deeper investigation. The paper recommends a bottom-up regulatory approach to create more effective and flexible ethical and legal guidelines for CPT applications. In conclusion, significant advancements have been made in CPT for eHealth, but ongoing research is essential to address current limitations, enhance user acceptability and adherence, and ensure ethical and legal soundness.}

abstract = {Thinking about what might have been—counterfactual thinking—is a common feature of the mental landscape. Key questions about counterfactual thinking center on why and how they occur and what downstream cognitive and behavioral outcomes they engender. The functional theory of counterfactual thinking aims to answer these and other questions by drawing connections to goal cognition and by specifying distinct functions that counterfactuals may serve, including preparing for goal pursuit and regulating affect. Since the publication of our last theoretical statement (Epstude & Roese, 2008), numerous lines of empirical evidence support, or are rendered more readily understandable, when glimpsed through the lens of the functional theory. However, other lines of evidence have called into question the very basis of the theory. We integrate a broad range of findings spanning several psychological disciplines so as to present an updated version of the functional theory. We integrate findings from social psychology, cognitive neuroscience, developmental psychology, clinical psychology, and health psychology that support the claim that episodic counterfactual thoughts are geared mainly toward preparation and goal striving and are generally beneficial for individuals. Counterfactuals may influence behavior via either a content-specific pathway (in which the counterfactual insight informs behavior change) or a content-neutral pathway (in which the negative affect from the counterfactual motivates generic behavior change). Challenges to the functional theory of counterfactual thinking center on whether counterfactuals typically cohere to a structural form amenable to goal striving and whether behavioral consequences are mainly dysfunctional rather than functional. Integrating both supporting and challenging evidence, we offer a new theoretical synthesis intended to clarify the literature and guide future research in multiple disciplines of psychology.}

This idea explains both rational and irrational motivations. In this paper, we revisit visual comprehension tasks based on this idea. At the theoretical level, we focus on the relationship between intuitive thinking, prior knowledge, and environmental information, and build a causal graph between the three. Further, inspired by the constructed causal graph, an intuitive optimization strategy with clear interpretability is proposed. In the validation session, we provide conclusions consistent with the theoretical analyses through extensive experiments on public datasets based on a visual quizzing task. Excitingly, our scheme demonstrates strong competitiveness in terms of generalizability without adding new technologies.}

abstract = {This paper presents an innovative methodology for parametric design called Design Procedures (DP) and shows how it is applied to the columns of the Expiatory Temple of the Sagrada Familia. Design Procedures are actions that generate parametric models where geometrical components are consider as variables. A brief introduction on parametric design is followed by illustrated explanations of the traditional forms of parametric models. Design Procedures is presented as an alternative to overcome the topological and geometrical limitations of traditional parametric models. The DP is able to generate all original designs by Gaudi plus an infinite number of new designs.}

abstract = {Invariance and symmetry principles have played a fundamental if not essential role in the theoretical development of the physical and mathematical sciences. More recently, Generalized Invariance Structure Theory (GIST; Vigo, 2013, 2015; Vigo et al., 2022) has extended this methodological trajectory with respect to the study and formal modeling of human cognition. Indeed, GIST is the first systematic and extensively tested mathematical and computational theory of concept learning and categorization behavior (i.e., human generalization) based on such principles. The theory introduces an original mathematical and computational framework, with novel, more appropriate, and more natural characterizations, constructs, and measures of invariance and symmetry with respect to cognition than existing ones in the mathematical sciences and physics. These have proven effective in predicting and explaining empirically tested behavior in the domains of perception, concept learning, categorization, similarity assessment, aesthetic judgments, and decision making, among others. GIST has its roots in a precursor theory known as Categorical Invariance Theory (CIT; Vigo, 2009). This paper gives a basic introduction to two different notions of human invariance detection proposed by GIST and its precursor CIT: namely, a notion based on a cognitive mechanism of dimensional suppression, rapid attention shifting, and partial similarity assessment referred to as binding (s-invariance) and a perturbation notion based on perturbations of the values of the dimensions on which categories of object stimuli are defined (p-invariance). This is followed by the first simple formal proof of the invariance equivalence principle from GIST which asserts that the two notions are equivalent under a set of strict conditions on categories. The paper ends with a brief discussion of how GIST, unlike CIT, may be used to model probabilistic process accounts of categorization, and how it naturally and directly applies to the learning of sequential categories and to multiset-based concept learning.}

Our limited equipment forces us to deal with only selected aspects of any given piece of that complex world at each instant. Selection—be it conscious or unconscious—involves agency and choice. Design and design thinking scholars have much to say about how agency and choice can be impacted by still other choices—context, symbols, movement, audience, and so on.

abstract = {Background
A Wellbeing Economy describes an economic system that places the wellbeing of current and future generations at its core, with the economy seen as a means to improved health, collective wellbeing and environmental sustainability. This paper reports our experiences of, and learning from, creating systems thinking, analysis and modelling tools for use by policy actors, and of forging university-policy partnerships to drive transformative action towards health and wellbeing.
Methods
The Systems Science in Public Health and Health Economics Research (SIPHER) works through co-production partnerships with local (Sheffield City Council), regional (Greater Manchester Combined Authority) and national (Scottish Government; Public Health Scotland) policy organisations. We designed, deployed, and triangulated between, different methods to gain an in-depth understanding of the respective policy systems, including: policy and stakeholder analysis, interviews; participatory systems mapping workshops; evidence gap mapping; dynamic spatial microsimulation and system dynamic modelling; elicitation of public preferences across different wellbeing economy outcomes; a decision support infrastructure; and community panels to shape and scrutinise our work.
Findings
Our focus was on exploring the public health and equity impacts of housing, income, work and community wealth building policies, including in response to pandemic, cost-of-living crisis and fuel poverty. Qualitative systems methods were particularly useful in articulating the multiple goals and priorities of a policy system around a shared, cohesive wellbeing narrative. Computational modelling and decision tools provided insights into targeting options, visualising trade-offs between different policy priorities (eg, overall health gains, equity gains or policy cost).
Interpretation
Co-produced qualitative analyses, data, computational models, and decision tools aided deeper exploration of systemic effects, including feedback processes and co-benefits/trade-offs that link such policies to future health and wellbeing. The process of applying diverse systems methods also led to a broadening of researcher perspectives, shifting ways-of-doing and facilitating both cross-disciplinary and cross-sector discussion and collaboration.

abstract = {The mechanisms of psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions are often investigated in fully formed illness, well after symptoms emerge. These investigations have yielded key insights but are not well positioned to reveal the dynamic forces underlying symptom formation itself. Understanding symptom development over time would allow us to identify steps in the pathophysiological process leading to psychosis, shifting the focus of psychiatric intervention from symptom alleviation to prevention. We propose a model for understanding the emergence of psychotic symptoms within the context of an adaptive, developing neural system. We make the case for a pathophysiological process that begins with cortical hyperexcitability and bottom-up noise transmission, which engenders inappropriate belief formation via aberrant prediction error signaling. We argue that this bottom-up noise drives learning about the (im)precision of new incoming sensory information because of diminished signal-to-noise ratio, causing a compensatory relative overreliance on prior beliefs. This overreliance on priors predisposes to hallucinations and covaries with hallucination severity. An overreliance on priors may also lead to increased conviction in the beliefs generated by bottom-up noise and drive movement toward conversion to psychosis. We identify predictions of our model at each stage, examine evidence to support or refute those predictions, and propose experiments that could falsify or help select between alternative elements of the overall model. Nesting computational abnormalities within longitudinal development allows us to account for hidden dynamics among the mechanisms driving symptom formation and to view established symptoms as a point of equilibrium among competing biological forces.}

We review basic and advanced computational models of predictive processing, expanding the range of computational, cognitive and sensorimotor capacities and enhancing their biological plausibility. Based on empirical evidence, major steps will need to be taken to flesh out how predictive processing may be precisely implemented in the brain, but the overall framework holds great potential as an explanatory framework in the neurosciences and psychology, strongly linking to Artificial Intelligence.}

This paper suggests a consistent framework for modeling human thinking by using the tools of both fields: fuzzy logical operators as well as aggregation and preference operators. In this framework, aggregation, preference, and the logical operators are described by the same unary generator function. Similarly to the implication being defined as a composition of the disjunction and the negation operator, preference operators were introduced as a composition of the aggregative operator and the negation operator. After a profound examination of the main properties of the preference operator, our main goal is the implementation into neural networks. We show how preference can be modeled by a perceptron, and illustrate the results in practical neural applications.}

The systematic literature search was performed in accordance with the PRISMA-2020 statement, and the initial search across four databases (Eric, Scopus, Web of Science, and Academic Research Ultimate) for papers published between January 2010 and May 2022 yielded 2672 peer-reviewed articles. Following the first evaluation, the application of the inclusion and exclusion criteria resulted in a shortlist of 22 papers. The results show different strategies that the teachers can use during play activities with coding toys, assuming the roles of facilitators and mediators through collaborative work, allowing children to try and fail. Moreover, the results revealed that ECEC teachers largely hold positive and constructive attitudes towards the use of coding toys. Findings also highlight positive outcomes regarding children’s development across various cognitive and socio-emotional skills such as problem solving, computational thinking and communication. As an improvement, future studies should focus on identifying appropriate pedagogies that may be applied in tandem with the technology to maximise the pedagogical benefits for the children as well as adequate training for teachers.}

A contribution of this paper, beyond the case example it provides, is that the emergent design evaluation was combined with design-based research, a complementary approach. Consistent with the practices uniquely characteristic of emergent design evaluation, this paper describes critical points or key occasions in which aspects of the intervention influence the evaluation process, or vice versa, including the nature and direction of influence. By demonstrating the process of combining emergent design evaluation and design-based research, this paper adds to discussions within the field about how to intentionally weave together different knowledge generation approaches that both meet evaluation demands and align with the evaluation context.}

The slowly resolving reproducibility crisis presents both a sobering warning and an opportunity to iterate on what science and data processing entails. The Square Kilometre Array (SKA), the world’s largest radio telescope, is among the most extensive scientific projects underway and presents grand scientific collaboration and data-processing challenges. In this work, we aim to improve the ability of workflow management systems to facilitate reproducible, high-quality science. This work presents a scale and system-agnostic computational workflow model and extends five well-known reproducibility concepts into seven well-defined tenets for this workflow model. Additionally, we present a method to construct workflow execution signatures using cryptographic primitives in amortized constant time. We combine these three concepts and provide a concrete implementation in Data Activated Flow Graph Engine (DALiuGE), a workflow management system for the SKA to embed specific provenance information into workflow signatures, demonstrating the possibility of facilitating automatic formal verification of scientific quality in amortized constant time. We validate our approach with a simple yet representative astronomical processing task: filtering a noisy signal with a lowpass filter using CPU and GPU methods. This example shows the practicality and efficacy of combining formal tenet definitions with a workflow signature generation mechanism. Our framework, spanning formal UML specification, principled provenance information collection based on reproducibility tenets, and finally, a concrete example implementation in DALiuGE illuminates otherwise obscure scientific discrepancies and similarities between principally identical workflow executions.}

In online tutoring, synchrony fosters better comprehension and engagement. Despite numerous methods to measure synchrony—such as lexical, syntactic, and semantic alignment—systematic comparisons across these approaches remain limited, impeding a full understanding of how synchrony operates across different educational contexts. This study addresses this gap by analyzing tutoring conversations from diverse contexts, particularly English as a Second Language (ESL) tutoring and algebra instruction, using seven computational models. These models yielded 29 synchrony indices, ranging from traditional lexical overlap to advanced natural language processing-based embedding models, capturing synchrony across multiple dimensions. Our results show that while these methods generally align with theoretical dimensions of synchrony, variations in embedding methods and distance measures can significantly impact their ability to capture meaningful interactions. Additionally, different subject domains influenced the finer-grained dimensions of synchrony observed, particularly in temporal aspects.}

abstract = {Traditional thinking mode in Chinese culture chronically emphasizes the whole observation and thinking, namely holistic view, pays attention to observe and think problems based on the development, evolution of things, and analyzes problem as time(s) changes, namely the dynamic view. It also emphasizes to explore deeply and reveal the internal essence through the study and observe the imagery of a matter, namely the essence view. For the engineering methodology, the current book emphasizes the combination between reductionism and holism theory, between analysis and integration, and between virtuality and substantiality. The new generation of the steel manufacturing process is proposed based on the thinking mode above. The thinking mode above clarifies that thinking and studying a new generation of the steel manufacturing process should neither consider things as its standard nor tend to the specific application of individual technology. The general theoretical study of integrity, openness, hierarchy, dynamic character in the steel manufacturing process is more important. The old method of figurative observation should be turned to the physical nature investigation of dynamic running process. Based on the rational abstract, concept research, top level design, the dynamic tailored design study and dynamic operation rules, etc., are performed. Thus the concept, connotation, function, design method, and operation rules of a new generation of the steel manufacturing process are established.}

abstract = {Loopholes offer an opening. Rather than comply or directly refuse, people can subvert an intended request by an intentional misunderstanding. Such behaviors exploit ambiguity and under-specification in language. Using loopholes is commonplace and intuitive in everyday social interaction, both familiar and consequential. Loopholes are also of concern in the law, and increasingly in artificial intelligence. However, the computational and cognitive underpinnings of loopholes are not well understood. Here, we propose a utility-theoretic recursive social reasoning model that formalizes and accounts for loophole behavior. The model captures the decision process of a loophole-aware listener, who trades off their own utility with that of the speaker, and considers an expected social penalty for non-cooperative behavior. The social penalty is computed through the listener’s recursive reasoning about a virtual naive observer’s inference of a naive listener’s social intent. Our model captures qualitative patterns in previous data, and also generates new quantitative predictions consistent with novel studies (N = 265). We consider the broader implications of our model for other aspects of social reasoning, including plausible deniability and humor.}

abstract = {Consumers often have to decide whether to make an effort and go to a remote store rather than a nearby one in order to obtain a lower price. Only the absolute price difference between the stores should be relevant in this case, but several experiments showed that people exhibit “relative thinking”: they are affected also by the relative savings (relative to the good’s price). This article analyzes the effects of this bias on firm strategy and market outcomes using a two-period game-theoretic model of location differentiation. Relative thinking causes consumers to make less effort to save a constant amount when they buy more expensive goods. In the location differentiation context this behavior can be modeled by consumers who behave as if their transportation costs are an increasing function of the good’s price. This gives firms an additional incentive to raise prices, in order to increase the perceived transportation costs of consumers, which consequently softens competition and allows higher profits. Therefore, the response of firms to relative thinking raises prices and profits and reduces consumer surplus, in both periods. Total welfare is unchanged in the first period, and in the second period it is either unchanged or reduced, depending on whether the objective or subjective transportation costs are used to compute welfare. The main results of the model (firms’ response to relative thinking increases prices and reduces consumer surplus) are likely to hold also in the context of search. The article also explains why “relative thinking” is a more appropriate term than “mental accounting” (which was often used before) to describe this behavior, and discusses why people might exhibit relative thinking.}

This work presents new climate performance indicators to evaluate business models (BM) based on life cycle assessment (LCA) and benchmarked with statistics for Sustainable Development Goal indicator 9.4.1. The research was conducted by action case studies involving 20 small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) from various sectors. The SMEs did not have previous experience with LCA. Therefore, a work process called “LCA á la carte” was designed to gradually increase details and effort. The results of simplified indicators on the manufacturing SMEs showed that the direct emissions to value added are lower than industry average. However, when upstream emissions and value added were included, the emission intensities are about industry average. The full life cycle climate indicators are presented for a boat production company that experiment with new BMs. Use phase electrification was found to be the most effective measure (60 % lower emission intensity), while material recycling and boat rental each reduced the emission intensity with about 30 %. However, a combination of these new BMs gives best results and could be needed to reach future benchmarks. This study suggests LCA for BM as a combination of a work process, actors' perspectives, and performance indicators. The results highlight that the scope of activities included in the performance indicators is crucial. New reporting standards such as the European Sustainable Development Standard (ESRS) should review the emission intensity indicators to ensure consistency between the scopes of activities included.}

In each of the classrooms a small number of computers and an interactive whiteboard (IWB) were utilised. This paper uses a case study approach to describe how engagement with Scratch and independent use of the IWB enabled children to work collaboratively to solve design challenges. Initial results indicate that the Scratch program is engaging for children. It created an environment where the children were, by necessity, using problem-solving processes such as goal setting, and generating and testing of ideas. The interactive whiteboard afforded rich opportunities for children to collaborate and share their thinking.

We found that, using the HLE, participants did learn from pretest to posttest, and that they most often engaged in strategy use SRL processes. However, the frequency of participant use of planning SRL processes, not strategy use, was predictive of learning. This study has implications for how educators use HLEs to foster historical thinking skills, and suggests that scaffolding planning skills may facilitate students’ use of computers as cognitive and metacognitive tools for learning (Azevedo, 2005; Lajoie, 2000).}

Hence, future research could focus on developing more practical RO tools for application to the energy industry, thus making the utilization of powerful “real options thinking” for decision making under uncertainty more widespread. This is particularly important for applications in low carbon power and energy systems with increasing renewable and sustainable energy resources, given the different types of uncertainty they are facing in the transition towards a truly Smart Grid. In order to do so, and based on an extensive relevant literature review, the analogies with financial options are first presented, with various assumptions and their validity being clearly discussed in order to understand if, when, and how specific methods can be applied. It is then argued how option theory is in most cases not directly applicable to investment in energy systems but requires the consideration of their physical characteristics. The paper finally gives recommendations for building practical RO approaches to energy system (and potentially all engineering) project investments under uncertainty, regardless of the scale, time frame, or type of uncertainty involved.}

Nexus Informatics develops the science of recognising and quantifying nexus interlinkages. Nexus-coherent solutions enhance the effect of policymaking in achieving adequate governance, leading to successful strategic vision and efficient resource management. In this article, we present the structure of a System Dynamics Model—the Nexus_SDM—that maps sector-specific data from major databases (e.g., EUROSTAT) and scenario models (e.g., E3ME-FTT OSeMOSYS and SWIM) for the national case study of Greece. Disaggregation algorithms are employed on annual national-scale data, turning them into detailed spatial and temporal datasets, by converting them to monthly values spread among all 14 River Basin Districts (RBDs). The Nexus_SDM calculates Nexus Interlinkage Factors and quantifies interlinkages among Water, Energy, Food, Built Environment, Natural Land and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. It simulates the nexus in the national case study of Greece as a holistic multi-sectoral system and provides insights into the vulnerability of resources to future socio-economic scenarios. It calculates the link between crop type/area, irrigation water and agricultural value, revealing which crops have the highest agricultural value with the least water and crop area. It demonstrates that fossil fuel power generation and use of oil for transportation are responsible for the most GHG emissions in most RBDs and presents projections for years 2030 and 2050. The analysis showcases that to move from a general nexus thinking to an operational nexus concept, it is important to focus on data availability and scale. Advanced Sankey and Chord diagrams are introduced to show distribution of resource use among RBDs and an innovative visualisation tool is developed, the Nexus Directional Chord plot, which reveals Nexus hotspots and strong interlinkages among sectors, facilitating stakeholder awareness.}

Here we investigated the associations of creativity measured by divergent thinking (CMDT) with resting-state functional magnetic imaging (fMRI) measures and their sex differences. We examined these relationships in the brains of 1277 healthy young adults. Whole-brain analyses revealed a significant interaction between verbal CMDT and sex on (a) regional homogeneity within an area from the left anterior temporal lobe (b) on the resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) between the mPFC and the left inferior frontal gyrus and (c) on fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (fALFF) in several distinct areas, including the precuneus and middle cingulate gyrus, left middle temporal gyrus, right middle frontal gyrus, and cerebellum. These interactions were mediated by positive correlations in females and negative correlations in males. These findings suggest that greater CMDT in females is reflected by (a) regional coherence (regional homogeneity) of brain areas responsible for representing and combining concepts as well as (b) the efficient functional connection (RSFC) between the key areas for the default state of cognitive activity and speech production, and (c) greater spontaneous neural activity (fALFF) during the resting of brain areas involved in frontal lobe functions, default cognitive activities, and language functions. Furthermore, these findings suggest that the associations between creativity and resting state brain connectivity patterns are different between males and females.}

abstract = {The paper presents a real novelty in Mathematical Modelling, which may have an enormous relevance in our way of Thinking, Decision Making and Acting. At the same time it would like to represent an explicit “Tribute” to Prof. Odum, because the original concept is already seminally present in his well-known Rules of Emergy Algebra. This novelty in Mathematical Modelling is represented by the so-called “Emerging Solutions”, which are radically different from solutions to traditional mathematical problems. This is because any traditional solution to an algebraic or differential problem is always represented by a formal expression that, when reintroduced into the initial formulation of the problem, reduces the latter to a perfect identity. Emerging Solutions, on the contrary, show an Ordinal Information content which is always much higher than the corresponding content pertaining to the initial formulation of the problem. Emerging Solutions, in fact, originate from any physical problem when this is modelled in accordance with the Maximum Ordinality Principle, and thus understood in Ordinal Terms. Such a property, which represents one of the most interesting aspects of the Maximum Ordinality Principle, then suggests we adopt a Generative way of Thinking when designing a new practical application. The same happens at the level of Will, that is at the level of Decision Making. Clearly, if we really want to take advantage of those “Emerging Exits” which arise from the physical behaviour of the system. Finally, at the level of Acting, if we are really interested in favouring any “emerging behaviour” of the system which is decisively capable to improve our design. For instance, to get the maximum intrinsic stability of the system, so as to prevent any possible disturbance that might significantly alter its expected behaviour. All these aspects will be illustrated through the case of Smart Grids, with particular reference to their large scale “intrinsic” instability and their recognized strong vulnerability to “cyber” attacks.}

abstract = {Computational activity is now recognized as a natural science, and computational and information processes have been discovered in the deep structures of many areas. Computations in the natural world were present long before the invention of computers, but a remarkable shift in understanding its fundamental nature occurs, in fact, before our eyes. The present moment, in fact, is a transition from the concept of computer science as an artificial science to the understanding that information processes are abundant in nature. Computing is recognized as a natural science that studies natural and artificial information processes. In everyday computing, operations are performed on the individual generators, with little attention paid to their internal structure. However, many common operations consist of more primitive constructions connected by a combination mode. The interaction of information processes and corresponding structures is carried out in an environment of “applicative interaction”, their applications to each other, and the study of the properties of this environment allows us to understand the nature of the computations. In the present work, the main attention is paid to elucidating the technological features of computations with individual generators, or objects. Their interaction is considered in an applicative environment, which allows us to elucidate the internal structure of ordinary operations, the knowledge of which allows us to understand their properties. The choice of initial constant generators, considered as generic ones and expressed by combinators, is discussed. These initial generators are used as the main “building blocks” that occur within the larger blocks of the applicative environment in interaction with each other. As a result of the interaction, constructions arise that give representative sets of ordinary operators and embedded computing systems.}

abstract = {Accurate parameter extraction from Photovoltaic (PV) models using current-voltage (I-V) data is essential for optimizing and simulating photovoltaic systems. Despite the existence of various techniques, many face challenges in achieving a balance between precision, robustness, computational efficiency, and execution time. In this paper, we present a novel hybrid algorithm, Differentiated Creative Search combined with Newton-Raphson (DCS-NR), designed to improve the accuracy and efficiency of PV parameter extraction. DCS employs a dual-strategy mechanism that balances exploration and exploitation through divergent and convergent thinking, ensuring a comprehensive search for solutions. The Newton-Raphson method further refines the parameters optimized by DCS, minimizing the discrepancy between estimated and measured currents, and consequently improving power estimation. The proposed approach is evaluated on three distinct models: Single Diode Model (SDM), Double Diode Model (DDM), and PV Module Model (PMM). Among the different models tested, DCS-NR consistently delivers superior accuracy. For example, it achieves an RMSE of 7.75392 × E−04 for the RTC France SDM and 1.77454 × E−04 for the PVM 752 cell, outperforming ten state-of-the-art metaheuristic algorithms. Moreover, DCS-NR demonstrates remarkable computational efficiency, requiring only 0.830 s on average for the RTC France SDM, which is considerably faster than algorithms such as Flying Foxes Optimization (251.5 s). Furthermore, it proves highly effective in real-world conditions, under varying irradiance and constant temperature, as well as vice versa. The method consistently converges within approximately 100 iterations, showcasing rapid optimization capabilities. These findings highlight the potential of DCS-NR as a powerful and versatile tool for photovoltaic parameter extraction, capable of addressing diverse and challenging scenarios.}

abstract = {Teaching for thinking refers to instruction intended to improve the effectiveness of people's thinking. A rationale for teaching for thinking is that students are expected to be effective thinkers but rarely are taught how to think. Teaching for thinking is intended to promote the ability to use what one has learned to solve new problems, which Wertheimer refers to as productive thinking. Teaching for thinking requires the consideration of four issues—what, how, where, and when to teach. Concerning what to teach, successful teaching for thinking focuses on helping students develop a collection of component skills for a particular cognitive task rather than on improving the mind in general. Concerning how to teach, successful teaching for thinking focuses on modeling the process of problem solving rather than solely drill and practice on getting the right answer. Concerning where to teach, successful teaching for thinking focuses on teaching within specific subject areas rather than in a content-independent course. Concerning when to teach, successful teaching for thinking includes teaching while students are novices rather than waiting until they have mastered all prerequisite basic skills.}
