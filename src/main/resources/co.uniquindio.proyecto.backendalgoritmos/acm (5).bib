abstract = {This paper describes a collaborative project that was conducted to promote K-8 Computer Science Education among in-service and pre-service teachers. More than 40 pre-service and in-service teachers participated in a learning experience designed to address the K-12 Computer Science Framework [2] and Maryland's K-12 Computer Science Standards. The collaboration was designed to facilitate participants' learning about and application of foundational principles of computer science and computational thinking into K-8 STEM curriculum and teaching. Participants explored hard/software platforms and used open-source sites such as Scratch, Code.org and Code Academy. Participants envisioned how activities apply to K-8 classrooms and worked in pairs or groups to design a problem-based project for students. Project evaluation included formative and summative assessments to examine changes in content and pedagogical knowledge.},

abstract = {INFACT aims to provide differentiable teaching and learning activities in Computational Thinking (CT) that are inclusive for neurodiverse learners in grades 3-8. Neurodiversity refers to learners with autism, ADHD, dyslexia, and other related cognitive differences. Underlying many neurodiverse conditions is differences with executive function (EF). In previous research on game-based learning, neurodiverse students became class leaders in CT activities [1]. Special education teachers noted that CT practices align with strategies they use to support problem-solving practices. Leveraging these affordances of CT, INFACT activities are designed with embedded EF scaffolds to support neurodiverse learners.},

abstract = {There is growing attention for integrating Computational Thinking (CT) into various subjects across the K-12 curriculum with a concomitant increase of interest in investigating teachers’ pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) regarding CT. This study is part of a bigger project focusing on defining the learning trajectories for CT integration into the K-12 curriculum. In particular, the present study focused on eliciting the pedagogical content knowledge and attitude of teachers with respect to the integration of CT in various disciplines. To this end, we implemented six different case studies by integrating CT into six different subjects: science, traffic, language, biology, geography, and physics. Two primary and four secondary school teachers were involved in the study. After the lesson series was completed in schools, we conducted interviews with teachers to understand their PCK on CT integration, attitudes toward CT integrated lessons, and the barriers teachers faced during CT integrated lessons. Our results indicate that compared to standard instructional activities, students can go deeper and understand the subject content better in CT integrated lessons, also students can use the power of digital technologies to solve subject-related problems. On the other hand, teachers pointed out that students and teachers need to be more capable of technical knowledge and skills to accomplish tasks.},

The main objective of the research plan is to propose a curricular approach of Computational Thinking (CT) competences through active methodologies in Primary Education classrooms. It is a study with a mixed methodology to obtain more detailed results; the quantitative phase consists of the development of a MOOC for teacher training in CT, evaluated through questionnaires, and the qualitative phase, a didactic proposal in which these competencies are developed, evaluated through interviews, or focus groups. Thus, we start from a state of the art where it is reflected, on the one hand, that teacher training in CT competences causes positive feedback in Primary Education classrooms and, on the other hand, the need to carry out this training and include CT, programming, and robotics in educational curricula.},

abstract = {Computational Thinking is seen as a crucial skill in an increasingly digital society. Researchers and educators in higher education therefore aim to improve the Computational Thinking (CT) skills of students using appropriate interventions. However, there is currently no overview of interventions used to teach CT and how effective they are. With this scoping literature review, we provide such an overview by identifying articles that discuss interventions used to teach CT in higher education. We identify the teaching approaches used in these interventions, and discuss their effectiveness and how this is assessed. Furthermore, we look at the use of adaptive interventions. Our search of three academic databases (Scopus, ACM and ERIC) resulted in 1839 articles. After screening, 49 articles remained. A detailed examination of the interventions discussed in these articles showed that CT is still often taught through programming assignments. The interventions are evaluated in a myriad of ways, making it difficult to compare the effectiveness of interventions. We therefore suggest making use of more standardized instruments to evaluate the effectiveness. Finally, although scaffolding is applied, interventions are not often adapted to the actual proficiency level of a student.},

Five commonly described aspects of culturally responsive instruction include: (1) helping students to value the perspectives of others, (2) affirming a sense of belonging, (3) validating students' cultural identities, (4) educating students about the diversity of the world around them,&nbsp; (5) supporting students to develop an awareness the impactful social structures.&nbsp; Research has shown repeatedly that CRT increases the academic success of ethnically diverse communities&nbsp; (Gay, 2018; Ladson-Billings, 1995). This talk will provide examples of how CRT has been incorporated into a Scratch-based, upper-elementary computational thinking curriculum that was developed specifically for English language learners.

abstract = {This mixed methods study examined barriers faced by three elementary schools in their approaches to integrating computational thinking (CT) into classroom instruction. Because CT is a relatively new instructional area, limited research guides CT integration, especially in bringing CT to academically, linguistically, and culturally diverse instruction. This study, therefore, examined challenges faced by teachers in bringing CT into their instructional practice. Data included interviews with 11 teachers and surveys of 46 teachers in a large, urban school district. The three schools in the district were part of a CS for All initiative in their school district. Data revealed common challenges: a) Limited CT teaching expertise; b) Limited time for CT integration; c) Lack of CT-specific assessment knowledge and tools; d) Limited pedagogical understanding for meeting students' diverse instructional needs; and e) Low teacher-buy-in for teaching CT. Our data also showed differences across schools in access to classroom implementation infrastructure such as technology and curricular resources, competing administrative priorities, and types of professional development opportunities. This study points to practical implications for supporting integration of CT in elementary contexts. Most notably, it is critical to proactively address these barriers in preservice and in-service teacher preparation as well as in school-wide infrastructure in order to have a sustained CT integration effort.},

A board game virtual interface was developed based on Unity-3D, and the corresponding device with a robotic arm was set up based on ESP32-CAM development board. The learning system enables a dual interaction mechanism by learning through Human-Machine Competition virtually or physically. By participating in the game, students faced challenges such as board game step reasoning, model abstract, decision-making, and strategic planning, thereby enhancing their computational thinking and problem-solving skills. Results indicated that the blended board game improve students’ overall computational thinking skills, especially reasoning, decision-making and strategic planning. This research provides an innovative approach to develop virtual-physical integrated game-based learning system for promoting students' computational thinking through human-machine competition.},

An explicit focus of this PD was to engage teachers in analyzing CT- and CRT-integrated science classroom scenarios (i.e., vignettes). Our analyses of video and written data of teachers' vignette responses indicate that while their understanding of CT increased as a result of the PD, the teachers need additional support around CRT.

As a result, new courses are being developed that connect research, pedagogy and technology within this nascent field. An example of this is Western University's Computational Thinking in Mathematics and Science Education course, which has been offered in year one of the Bachelor of Education program since 2015 and is part of the STEM cohort. Research has been conducted during each iteration of the course and subsequent adjustments were made in order to better serve the preservice teachers as well as respond to new insights in the field. The preservice teachers have completed at least one university degree, mostly in the areas of science or mathematics, prior to beginning their Bachelor of Education degree. This lightning talk presents highlights from the most recent version of the course following this iterative process of course design. The 36-hour course provides pre-service teachers with opportunities to explore hands-on-activities and theoretical-based approaches to Computational Thinking and pedagogy in grades 7-12, all within a blended learning context. The researchers will be further studying the pre-service teacher experience and are looking to provide recommendations for other preservice teacher education programs as well as in-service professional development programs.},

Specifically, we present a standalone educational technology course with explicit attention on connecting CT to disciplinary content and pedagogy while introducing a range of digital tools. Data were collected from 34 pre-service teachers over the period of one semester. Specifically, a total of 68 lesson plans developed by pre-service teachers through two distinct lesson planning tasks using concept mapping and programming tools were collected and analyzed using both quantitative and qualitative techniques. The analysis utilized a coding scheme that focused on identifying specific CT practices illustrated in each lesson. It also examined differences in the CT practices exhibited in each lesson planning task. Findings indicated that the CT practice of data was most prevalent in pre-service teachers' lesson plans. Outside of data, however, there was greater variation in the CT practices represented in programming lesson plans compared to the concept mapping lesson plans. Implications for teacher educators are discussed based on the findings.},

The social dialogues from this exploratory study demonstrate the interactive reasoning process in computational thinking (CT) education and reveal that dialogic learning has the potential to promote learning emotions and CT skills development in CT education. This study thus points to the future Child-Computer Interaction (CCI) research agenda that considers social dialogues in CT education with tangible play. A new understanding of social dialogues in CT toys and CT education can provide educators and CCI researchers with socio-technical insights into the future educational practices and design of CT games and technology for young children.},

abstract = {With the continuous development of information technology, computational thinking has become a necessary quality for students to adapt to the era of artificial intelligence in the 21st century. After the release of the Information Technology Curriculum Standards for Compulsory Education (2022 edition), computational thinking has rapidly attracted wide attention. This paper adopts the bibliometrics method to study the core journals and dissertations on the training of primary school students' computational thinking collected by CNKI (China National Knowledge Network) from 2012 to 2023, and analyzes the current situation and trend of the training of primary school students' computational thinking from the aspects of the number of literatures, sources, research hotspots and frontiers, combined with Citespace software. It provides useful reference for related researchers.},
