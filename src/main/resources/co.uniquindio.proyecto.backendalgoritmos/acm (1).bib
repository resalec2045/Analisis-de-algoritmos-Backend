abstract = {Since Jeanette Wing’s influential 2006 article, research into developing Computational Thinking (CT) skills has surged. Despite ongoing debates about CT definitions and components, reliable and valid assessment tools are crucial for measuring CT skill impact and evaluating related interventions. This systematic literature review seeks to identify CT assessment tools suitable for undergraduate computing students, by investigating the central question "What tools are available for the assessment of CT skills?". A comprehensive search of academic databases for CT assessment publications since 2006 yielded 202 unique articles. After applying exclusion criteria, 72 relevant articles were analyzed. The selected publications were categorized by tool type, and focus, examining tool reliability and validity. This paper presents initial findings from this review.},

abstract = {The adoption of Computational Thinking (CT) in the educational worldwide curricula is progressively gaining importance from various perspectives. One particular approach, known as unplugged, does not require electronic devices and offers notable benefits as it is replicable and adaptable. Moreover, it serves to dismantle the misconception that computer science is exclusively confined to the digital realm. While both plugged and unplugged methodologies are recognized, further exploration of the unplugged approach is required, especially in Upper Secondary Education, where there is less evidence of its effectiveness. This paper presents a summary of a quasi-experimental study conducted with 11th grade students (approximately 16 years old) in a Spanish public high school. 57 students participated: 28 in the control group and 29 in the experimental group. The conducted research, based on a quantitative and experimental design, aimed to investigate the effectiveness of unplugged activities to improve CT abilities in Upper Secondary Education. The results indicated improved skills in the experimental group, suggesting the potential efficacy of unplugged methods in fostering CT abilities.},

abstract = {In learning to program and understanding how a programming language controls a computer, learners develop both insights and misconceptions whilst their mental models are gradually refined. It is important that the learner is able to distinguish the different elements and roles of a computer (compiler, interpreter, memory, etc.), which novice programmers may find difficult to comprehend. Forming accurate mental models is one of the potential sources of difficulty inextricably linked to mastering computing concepts and processes, and for learning computer programming.It is common to use some form of representation (e.g., an abstract machine or a Computational Agent (CA)) to support technical or pedagogic explanations. The Notional Machine (NM) is a pedagogical device that entails one or more computational concepts, originally described as an idealised computer operating with the constructs of a particular programming language. It can be used to support specific or general learning goals and will typically have some concrete representation that can be referred to. Computational Thinking (CT), which is defined as a way of thinking that is used for [computational] problem solving, is often presented as using a CA to carry out information processing presented by a solution.In CT, where the typical goal is to produce an algorithm or a computer program, the CA seemingly serves a purpose very similar to an NM. Although it changes through the different stages of development (of the learner and of the curriculum), the roles of CAs and NMs can be seen as versatile tools that connect a learner’s mental model with the conceptual model of a program. In this article, we look at this relationship between CAs and NMs, and indicate how they would look at different stages of learning. We traverse the range of definitions and usages of these concepts, and articulate models that clarify how these are viewed in the literature. This includes exploring the nature of machines and agents, and how historical views of these relate to modern pedagogy for computation. We argue that the CA can be seen as an abstract, simplified variant of an NM that provides a useful perspective to the learner to support them to form robust mental models of NMs more efficiently and effectively. We propose that teaching programming should make use of the idea of a CA at different stages of learning, as a link that connects a learner’s mental model to a full NM.},

We posit that an effective CT pathway for rural communities must be firmly rooted in their cultural wealth, funds of knowledge, and socioeconomic priorities. Moreover, it should empower students to draw upon their own innovation heritage, leveraging CT as a tool to identify and address community challenges. Emphasizing the necessity of incorporating rural contexts into discussions on equitable access to computing education, our conceptualization provides insights into how policy and research can contribute to this important goal.},

abstract = {Despite widespread recognition of the importance of computer science (CS) education and an increased focus on computational thinking (CT) instruction in the U.S., there remains a significant shortage of qualified K-12 CS teachers. Preparing preservice teachers to teach CS is essential for ensuring a sustainable future for CS education. This experience report presents a CT/CS module initiative designed to prepare secondary preservice science and math teachers to teach CT/CS through an instructional methods course that integrates instructional practice within an elementary after-school program. This initiative employs the preservice teacher preparation framework that includes the observe-practice-reflect cycle. Within this framework, the preservice teachers began with incorporating unplugged lessons and then transitioned to robotics to teach CT/CS concepts. In this experience report, we detail the design and implementation of this CT/CS module initiative and share findings that revealed the preservice teachers' increased confidence, adaptations in lesson planning, and the challenges faced in teaching CT/CS. These takeaways aim to inspire and inform other teacher educators and practitioners working to prepare the next generation of CS teachers.},

abstract = {This paper presents a study about the mapping of the EUDability of End-User Development (EUD) tools with the Computational Thinking (CT) skills of users. This mapping provides an approach to evaluate the suitability of a EUD environment in supporting people performing their daily work while managing and exploiting EUD tools. EUDability is a construct encompassing different dimensions that need to be assessed through a careful scrutiny by human-computer interaction experts, while CT skills should mirror those dimensions from the point of view of assessing the level of ability of users in managing problems with a computational thinking attitude. Moving from the healthcare domain, we present two cases: a tool for geriatric professionals supporting them in the preparation of cognitive exercises for elderly patients; and a tool for pharmacists, which empowers them to create robot programs related to the preparation of personalized medications. These cases have been exploited to show how to unify the EUDability assessment with the CT skills assessment. In particular, the application of the EUDability evaluation method for each tool, as well as the administration of the Computational Thinking Scale to domain experts are shown. The results of the two assessments are reported and discussed, together with the limitations of the present study. The results show the goodness of fit of the proposed EUD tools in the healthcare domain.},

abstract = {Within a two-year urban teacher residency program at [University], which focuses on training high school teachers to incorporate computational thinking (CT) into STEM education with an emphasis on equity, this study delves into how these preservice teaching residents (TRs) understood and applied CT in high school STEM settings. Based on our initial thematic content analysis of ten 30-minute artifact-based interviews, teachers' understanding and application of CT could be categorized in two ways: 1) One group of teachers showcased clear, explicit knowledge of CT and actively incorporated it into their instruction; 2) Another group, despite their evident understanding of CT, subtly and implicitly integrated CT into their teaching methods. Our findings suggest that while TRs may differ in whether they explicitly or implicitly integrated CT into their lesson plans, their comments suggest that they have foundational understandings and hold values that suggest they can build upon them. The TRs held definitional understandings of CT and had intentions to design and teach with CT integration, explicitly, or more commonly, implicitly. All of the TRs recognized opportunities in their lesson plans for teaching CT to students, which suggests the potential for more explicit integration in the future. These insights guide our subsequent efforts in teacher training, ensuring educators are equipped to weave CT into STEM lessons. Our findings contribute to a growing body of work that seeks to build strong preservice teaching practices, as they learn to translate CT knowledge into effective teaching practices while working towards higher levels of CT integration.},

abstract = {Maker-based learning and Computational Thinking (CT) have increased in popularity in formal educational settings over the past decade. Particularly, the combination of CT and making seem to hold promise for providing opportunities for students to learn and use computing concepts outside of computing courses. This paper presents findings from a two year study of the integration of computational making into 5th and 6th grade science classrooms. Students participated in computational making interventions in which they programmed Arduino microcontrollers to create scientific models of concepts that aimed to help them engage with the science content while learning CT and making skills. In this paper, we explore the differences between the desired computing learning progressions, students' performance on assessments, and perceptions of computer science to answer: To what extent are middle school students able to learn computing through computing integrated science curriculum? We observed that the programming concepts taught were largely dependent on the needs of the science and making project. Our findings suggest that while students had opportunities to learn and use programming concepts, their performance on assessments was between 15\% and 78\% correct for conceptual and applied questions and their programming self-efficacy and their perceptions of computer science were lower than desired. We discuss the implications of these findings and the factors that impact the integration of CT in core disciplines and the challenges this presents as we aim to use integration approaches to effectively teach computing outside of computing courses and to broaden participation in computing.},

abstract = {In this study we examine the use of CT skills when solving Bebras tasks. Bebras tasks are logical puzzles created to introduce, practice and sometimes assess Computational Thinking (CT) skills. We use the think-aloud method to investigate the problem-solving process of participants with advanced CT skills. The contribution of this study is three-fold. First, the study examines how the use of CT skills manifests itself in the problem-solving process. By examining the thought process of participants, our study provides a detailed operationalization of CT skill definitions that could be used in subsequent studies to investigate the use of the skills. Secondly, the study provides a validation of the classification of a selection of Bebras tasks. Our results show that the skills assigned to these Bebras are indeed the skills most often used by the problem solvers while solving the tasks. Finally, even though the skills are used, the results also show that this does not always translate into answering these puzzles correctly. Based on the results we therefore conclude that, without looking at the problem-solving process, the tasks may not be suitable for the assessment of CT skills.},

However, coding activities are predominantly sedentary in front of the screen, and the application of physical play in Computer Science education is less explored, e.g., how can we engage in computational thinking (CT) through physical play? In this design-based exploration, we conducted three design activities where young children, college students, and researchers were invited to create physical play projects using the BBC micro:bit and reflect on their experiences. By examining participants’ projects and creating processes, we provide empirical evidence that remixing physical play activities with coding can engage learners in various CT concepts and practices, reveal how CT concepts and practices can be represented in physical play, and highlight implications for designing physical play-mediated computational learning experiences. Ultimately, we encourage more learning experiences to incorporate physical play into computing education for children.},

This panel examines the experiences of practitioners - educators, administrators, and curriculum designers--who have both experienced and supported others in incorporating CT in elementary school settings as a pathway to or component of computer science education. All panelists have worked with teachers not previously trained to teach CS and have encountered the many opportunities and difficulties of bringing CS to in-service teachers. They will reflect on the multiple ways educators grapple with CT: as an entry point to computer science, as a way to enrich core disciplines, and as a way to support equitable practice - for example, several of the panelists have experiences leveraging CT and other domains of CS to support the expression and development of emergent bilingual students. The panel will explore ways in which CT and its associated language and strategies for problem solving may provide a particularly helpful onramp to CS generally, including integration with other disciplines and with language about academic skills more generally.},

abstract = {The recent emphasis on computational thinking (CT) integration across disciplines in elementary education nationwide is important to ensure that students are well-equipped to meet the demands of the data-driven workforce. However, this requirement poses major challenges to early elementary teachers who are faced with little direction in terms of how best to implement and assess their young student's application of these new practices.This project engaged researchers, professional development (PD) providers, and K-2 teachers to develop and design a hybrid PD experience to support teachers in a process of learning about and identifying the use of CT skills and strategies in their students' work. The hybrid PD approach utilized a combination of instructional coaching, both face-to-face and through an online Community of Practice. Researchers used a mixed-methods design to measure teachers' change over time in their understanding of how to identify emergent computational thinking in their students' work process. Data collection methods included teacher focus groups and interviews, classroom observations, and teacher pre- and post-surveys.Preliminary findings showed an increase in teachers' understanding of CT and confidence in engaging their students in CT-integrated lessons. Teachers reported that the combination of in-person PD and online Community of Practice helped them prepare to bring CT into their classroom and cited placing more of a distinct focus on teaching students the process of CT rather than just using CT vocabulary. Teachers also referenced success in evaluating their students' application of CT skills and concepts by using informal and formative assessment strategies that focus on evidence of student understanding rather than assessing CT vocabulary.},

Students took a quantitative test on computational thinking and another on AI before and after the intervention, and teachers and students also took a questionnaire at the end of it. The results showed that: i) quantitative tests can be used to reliably measure, in terms of internal consistency, the level of development of computational thinking and AI literacy in the Spanish school population of these ages; ii) it is possible to develop students’ computational thinking skills and raise their level of AI literacy through programming activities; iii) the intervention contributed to demystifying the main prejudices regarding AI; iv) a gender gap was found in relation to previous knowledge and experiences with these topics. Overall, the study concluded that introducing the foundations of AI in primary and secondary education in Spain is appropriate, feasible, and relevant.},

abstract = {The aim of the doctoral thesis is to model an automated computational thinking (CT) assessment system based on solving processes of the interactive tasks. Currently, a literature review and analysis has been carried out, which has shown that among current CT assessment tools most popular ones still remain different types of tests. A study, comparing the two computational thinking assessment tests has been conducted and it has been observed that using only the tests causes data loss as tests do not collect information on the solution processes. An experiment was carried out to collect and analyze action information while solving the task and using this data to extract the possible different solution methods of an interactive task.},

abstract = {CADRE (Catalyst for Actively Designing and Researching Equity) is a Researcher-Practitioner Partnership (RPP) that empowers in-service K-12 educators to learn and leverage Computational Thinking (CT) to design for equity in their classrooms, schools, and districts. We cast equity gaps as bugs in education and focus on helping educators debug the system with CT-based tools, methods, and strategies such as user-centered design, system abstraction, and iteration. In this paper, we first describe how educators were taught CT and provide an example of how they applied these skills in practice. We then highlight the results of the qualitative case study of 34 educators where we found that CT helped CADRE participants gain a better understanding of the equity gaps their students faced and improve their instructional practices within their locus of control. Implications for future research are also discussed.},

abstract = {We have developed a quantitative tool for assessing senior high school students' computational thinking skills and administered it in the Taipei metropolitan area of Taiwan. Our CT test is language/tool/knowledge-independent and focuses on four key CT concepts: decomposition, data representation, algorithms, and pattern generalization. Our paper outlines the development process of the CT test, including its constructs, reliability, and validity, and discusses its educational implications for computing courses. This CT test provides a valuable resource for computing teachers who wish to assess their students' CT abilities and tailor their teaching methods accordingly.},
