abstract = {With the continuous development of information technology, computational thinking has become a necessary quality for students to adapt to the era of artificial intelligence in the 21st century. After the release of the Information Technology Curriculum Standards for Compulsory Education (2022 edition), computational thinking has rapidly attracted wide attention. This paper adopts the bibliometrics method to study the core journals and dissertations on the training of primary school students' computational thinking collected by CNKI (China National Knowledge Network) from 2012 to 2023, and analyzes the current situation and trend of the training of primary school students' computational thinking from the aspects of the number of literatures, sources, research hotspots and frontiers, combined with Citespace software. It provides useful reference for related researchers.},

abstract = {This poster outlines the design and results of a course entitled "Computational Thinking in Music." The course teaches computational thinking principles as a general education objective to undergraduate students, using data-driven investigation to inform musical composition. Students compose a song to imitate an artist of their choice by analyzing data extracted from a corpus of crowd-sourced pop song transcriptions. Students learn principles of abstraction, decomposition, and algorithmic thinking; no coding experience is required. Quantitative and qualitative results indicate that students are learning and applying computational thinking principles. Since the course is designed and taught by a musician and is run in the music department, students also learn a significant amount of music theory and composition, including harmonic structures and harmonization principles, melodic organization, consonance and dissonance, aural analysis of formal structures and meter, and influence of rhythm and timbre to create desired sounds.},

abstract = {Linking sustainable development with computational thinking promotes high-impact problem solving, integrating fundamental concepts of computer programming. This study analyzed the relationship between computational thinking and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) using text mining and data visualization techniques. A text mining method was employed to analyze computational thinking and its sub-competencies (decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction and algorithm) appearances in the OSDG Community dataset, consisting of 32,120 text fragments labeled with the associated SDG. Results revealed that computational thinking and its subcompetencies: decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction, and algorithm, were frequently linked to SDGs 4 (quality education), SDG 5 (gender equality), SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), and SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities). The findings demonstrate the potential of computational thinking to provide innovative solutions to global problems and support the achievement of the SDGs. The study can be of value to stakeholders in the social, governmental, academic and business sectors interested in sustainable development and educational innovation in the application of computational thinking.},

abstract = {With a focus on problem resolution, Computational Thinking (CT) can assist in developing cognitive abilities. A way to work with CT is using educational digital games (EDG), a ludic tool that stimulates the students’ learning. Still, adjustments are needed so that students with Intellectual Disabilities (ID) can use these games. Based on this scenario, we presented a Bachelor’s final paper that envisioned the creation of an EDG, aiming to contribute to the learning of the target audience, based on the promotion of the development of CT. Called “Pensar e Vestir”, the game uses the four pillars of CT by addressing choosing and wearing clothes. For that, the development counted with a multidisciplinary group – stakeholders and specialists from the areas of Computer Science, Education, Specialized Educational Assistance, and ID – and followed the Simple Interaction Design lifecycle model, with the definition of requirements, designing alternatives, prototyping, and evaluation. As a result, this EDG has two phases and eight situations each: time to sleep, the school in the heat, school in the cold, costume, park, tour, teacher, and market. The game was evaluated by specialists, Computing students, and one neurotypical child, we also intend to make a large evaluation with the target audience. As an outcome, the interaction design process with different stakeholders and specialists provides different insights and improvements to the game. Also, the game is accessible to neurotypical and with ID students.},

abstract = {Students of Computer Science often struggle with the abstract nature of the content of their studies, especially in the student entry phase. This is partly due to the fact that on the one hand, many first year students possess only moderate abstract thinking skills, while on the other hand, Computer Science lecturers often take the existence of abstract thinking skills for granted, as they themselves are well versed in this area. To bridge this gap and foster the students’ abstract thinking skills, we employ haptic material to make abstract tasks and the corresponding solution processes more tangible. This supports the development of abstract thinking skills, and at the same time helps to actively engage students in our classes on software development. In this paper we describe our experiences with active classroom learning units based on haptic materials, as part of our inverted classroom teaching.},

abstract = {Computational Thinking (CT), entailing both domain-general and domain-specific skills, is a competency fundamental to computing education and beyond. However, as a cross-domain competency, appropriate assessment design and method remain equivocal. Indeed, the majority of the existing assessments have a predominant focus on measuring programming proficiency and neglecting other contexts in which CT can also be manifested. To broaden the promotion and practice of CT, it is necessary to integrate diverse problem types and item formats using a competency-based assessment method to measure CT. Taking a psychometric approach, this article evaluates a novel computer-based assessment of CT competency, Computational Thinking Challenge. The assessment was administered to 119 British upper secondary school students (M = 16.11; SD = 1.19) with a range of prior programming experiences. Results from several reliability analyses, a convergent validity analysis, and a Rasch analysis, provided evidence to support the quality of the assessment. Taken together, the study demonstrated the feasibility to expand from traditional assessment methods to integrating multiple contexts, problem types, and item formats in measuring CT competency in a comprehensive manner.},

And since CT has been formalized only recently, many existing boardgames unknowingly might support aspects of CT. To help educators and game practitioners navigate this complex landscape, we analyze a selected sample of analog games, and propose to categorize their features with respect to CT concepts and practices. The main contribution of this paper is a novel way to identify potential CT-relevant games, that leverages on the authors’ experience with digital and analog games, playful and game-based learning. Although limited, this approach appears promising and practical for CT teachers and game designers interested in adapting existing games to the classroom or developing better CT-supporting boardgames.},

To address this gap in knowledge, this study made use of learning trajectories (LTs; hypothesized learning goals, progressions, and activities) in CT concept areas such as sequence, repetition, conditionals, and decomposition to better understand students’ CT. This study implemented eight math-CT integrated lessons aligned to U.S. national mathematics education standards and the LTs with third- and fourth-grade students. This basic interpretive qualitative study aimed at gaining a deeper understanding of elementary students’ CT by having students express and articulate their CT in cognitive interviews. Participants’ (n = 22) CT articulation was examined using a priori codes translated verbatim from the learning goals in the LTs and was mapped to the learning goals in the LTs. Results revealed a range of students’ CT in problem-solving, such as using precise and complete problem-solving instructions, recognizing repeating patterns, and decomposing arithmetic problems. By collecting empirical data on how students expressed and articulated their CT, this study makes theoretical contributions by generating initial empirical evidence to support the hypothesized learning goals and progressions in the LTs. This article also discusses the implications for integrated CT instruction and assessments at the elementary level.},

abstract = {In the information age, online teaching will gradually become an inevitable trend in the era of modern education informatization. Online teaching has the advantages of easy operation and abundant resources, but it has higher requirements for the design of teaching mode and teaching content. Computational thinking, as the core idea of IT teaching, emphasizes the long-term development and deep development of IT learning, which has great practical significance for students to improve themselves and cultivate their ability development. So in the online teaching of high school IT courses, how to build an online teaching mode suitable for students' development and achieve the purpose of effectively cultivating students' computational thinking? This study combines specific teaching, guided by constructivist theory, nearest developmental zone theory, situational cognition and other theories, and uses literature research method, questionnaire survey method, quasi-experimental research method and other research methods to conduct a study on the construction and validation of online teaching model of high school information technology geared to the cultivation of computational thinking. The results of the study showed that the proposed teaching model was found to have a significant promotion effect on students' academic performance and computational thinking through the examination of students' academic performance and computational thinking.},

abstract = {Prior research has explored potential applications of video games in programming education to elicit computational thinking skills. However, existing approaches are often either too general, not taking into account the diversity of genres and mechanisms between video games, or too narrow, selecting tools that were specifically designed for educational purposes. In this paper we propose a more fundamental approach, defining beneficial connections between individual design patterns present in video games and computational thinking skills. We argue that video games have the capacity to elicit these skills and even to potentially train them. This could be an effective method to solidify a conceptual base which would make programming education more effective.},
