abstract = {This paper reports on a professional development (PD) effort in which 12 elementary teachers (K-5) in a rural, under-resourced school were equipped with the skills needed to integrate computer science activity into the regular math curriculum. Over the course of a year, the teachers engaged in a week-long summer workshop and monthly follow-up training with in-classroom support as they integrated educational robots into their math curriculum. Surveys, tests, and teacher lesson plans were analyzed to better understand how the PD contributed to teacher's knowledge and skills. Wilcoxon Signed-Rank tests indicated that teacher rankings on their attitudes towards and planning practices with educational robots were statistically significantly higher at the end of the PD. The improvement was further reflected in the quality of their lesson plans. Implications for preparing teachers to use educational robots to teach computer science in elementary mathematics are discussed.},

abstract = {While understanding in the field of how CT can be used in early childhood is limited, current CT definitions include skills and practices that align with early mathematics and science learning goals outlined in national frameworks (e.g., Head Start Early Learning Outcomes Framework) and state standards. In order to understand which elements of CT align with the abilities and interests of young children and how they can be integrated with early science and math experiences in a mutually supportive manner, we partnered with preschool teachers and families to co-design and pilot test hands-on (unplugged) and digital activities for classrooms and homes.Our collaborative research identified the following CT skills as productive starting points for our co-design work: (1) problem decomposition; (2) algorithmic thinking; (3) abstraction; and (4) testing and debugging. This paper describes our approach to operationalizing CT for early learning and our empirical research around activities designed to understand how CT can be linked with math and science to create powerful learning experiences for preschool learners. Our work involves actively fostering a home-school connection for promoting CT and prioritized designing for activities that fit the ecology of preschool classrooms and homes (with special attention to family activities). With a view to designing equity-oriented experiences, we partnered with preschools serving historically underserved communities, and centered families' funds of knowledge. This paper focuses specifically on the home component of the program and shares data and analyses about children's and parent's experiences at home---which activities were more successful and resonated with children and families, and which specific synergies emerged between CT skills, math and science concepts and practices. Our findings highlight the promise of introducing early CT to support early learning, and especially involving families in the process. Results from our research also identified challenges that should be addressed in future iterations of this design research We believe our family connection activities are not only a unique part of the research but also an exemplar of what should be an essential piece of STEM education for young learners.},

Twenty-five children ages 8 to 13 in two cohorts tested the MoS software during a half-day workshop held at the Lawrence Hall. In addition to using the MoS software to create beautiful and original works of art, children also engaged in hands-on crafts and inquiry-based math activities to further promote learning of spherical geometry and computational thinking. MoS software workshop had a positive impact on children's engagement, but had mixed results about their understanding of geometry as evidenced by direct observations and results from pre/post-surveys, which are reported here.},

Particularly when short game design activities are integrated into already existing middle school courses, research suggests that game design is effective in broadening participation and motivating large numbers of students, along with large percentages of women and minorities. A study with over 10,000 students is exploring the sustainability of this approach and finding positive responses to inquiries such as these: Do teachers continue to use game design? Can they advance beyond extrinsic rewards such as research stipends? After building one game, do students advance, building more games or even STEM simulations?},

abstract = {This study introduces the Concrete Computational Concepts Programming Environments (3CPEs), an innovative approach designed to help elementary students grasp abstract computational concepts through concrete metaphors using tangible and everyday objects. Traditional programming environments for children focus on concrete programming language syntax and semantics yet often fall short in conveying advanced computational concepts. To address this gap, 3CPEs combine the hands-on appeal of computer-science unplugged activities with the versatility of programming environments, using familiar objects and gamified elements to visualize abstract computational and algorithmic ideas. An example is CT (Computational Thinking) Chef, a 3CPEs implementation to enhance elementary students’ understanding of programming concepts. Through design workshops with five elementary programming teachers, we preliminarily identified teaching challenges and evaluated 3CPEs’ efficacy as an educational tool. The feedback underscores CT Chef’s potential in facilitating the teaching of intricate computational concepts for young learners.},

abstract = {In recent years, several research projects have introduced elementary school teachers to computational thinking as a first step in familiarizing students with computer science concepts at an early age. A consistent challenge reported in these initiatives is teaching abstraction. This position paper offers preliminary recommendations for abstraction pedagogy in elementary education. These suggestions stem from an analysis of unplugged abstraction examples showcased during a summer institute on computational thinking.By examining commonalities among abstraction examples, key parts of the process of abstraction pertinent to elementary classrooms were identified: (1) the abstraction process is typically performed in reverse since students in elementary school are given abstractions to start with; (2) evaluation of concrete details to support an abstraction is part of the filtering step of abstraction; (3) in the absence of evaluation criteria, pattern recognition can be applied to a set of concrete examples to extract characteristics of an abstraction; and (4) abstractions can be supported by not only concrete details but other abstractions which students will need to develop an understanding of before fully comprehending the initial concept.Preliminary recommendations for abstraction instruction include having students evaluate examples; engaging students in pattern recognition to extract characteristics of an abstraction; developing student fluency in describing abstractions, their supporting examples, and characteristics; and assessing students by asking not only for examples of abstractions, but for their characteristics as well.},

During this interval, we initiated a programming education program for students ranging from elementary to high school, utilizing the metaverse capabilities of Minecraft. The primary participants in this initiative were educators and students from two private programming institutions. Students engaged in a simulated school experience that leveraged Minecraft's command and Redstone based programming functionalities. Furthermore, the collaborative nature of the metaverse enhanced students' programming and computational thinking abilities. This poster will first delineate the distinctive features of Minecraft's programming environment in contrast to visual programming platforms such as Scratch. Subsequently, we will analyze students' experiences within the metaverse, focusing on peer interaction and the enhancement of motivation towards programming. Finally, we will conduct an evaluation and propose directions for future research.},

abstract = {Decomposition is a foundational computational thinking construct that is often introduced early as students are learning computer science in the elementary grades. Although decomposition is often described in early computational activities, little research exists about how to teach and assess students’ understanding of decomposition. In this mixed-methods research study, 173 third-grade students from eight elementary school classrooms in the Midwest were taught eight lessons that integrated decomposition as well as other computational thinking practices into their mathematics instruction. They completed a computational thinking assessment after the first four lessons and again after the second four lessons. Analyses included the distribution of correct decomposition item responses, confirmatory factor analysis, and item-level error analysis. Results indicate wide variability in students’ performance on the decomposition assessment items as well as in performance on items contextualized within mathematics. This study highlights the need for additional considerations about assessing computational understanding, implications for assessment within integrated contexts, and the use of paper-and-pencil tests compared to embedded assessments.},

With eTeacher, we take away this burden from the teacher and allow students to work independently and at their own pace. In particular, we present a platform with an integrated course text for Computational Thinking. eTeacher is available on every device, gives automatic code-feedback both content-wise and on programming style and provides exercises of different types and levels. Teachers can monitor their students individually and consult statistics. The platform was extensively evaluated in a pilot at 20 schools.},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel pedagogical framework, entitled the Zones of Proximal Flow, which integrates Vygotsky's Zone of Proximal Development theory with Csikszentmihalyi's ideas about Flow. Flow focuses on the individual-- an individual is in Flow when challenges are balanced with skills. The Zone of Proximal Development, on the other hand, brings in a social learning aspect focusing on a student's ability to learn concepts with external support. From our research experiences bringing game and simulation design into middle school classrooms, we attempt to provide students with appropriate challenges using a project-first based approach that aims to keep students in Flow. The project-first approach employs inquiry based scaffolding to guide students, with appropriate support by their teachers, through Vygotsky's Zone of Proximal Development, back in to Csikszentmihalyi's state of Flow for an ideal learning experience. We call this space the Zones of Proximal Flow. Data indicate that the Zones of Proximal Flow approach works, keeping classrooms engaged in the act of game design and enabling students to advance to more complex program creations.},

We examine toys and kits sold commercially, developed through research, and used in early childhood classrooms. Our findings indicate that the mathematical and spatial concepts are overlooked in some designs. Prior research examined toys for their affordances related to computational thinking, the present study contributes to understanding of how these toys and kits have the potential to foster foundational mathematics and spatial skills.

abstract = {As teacher professional development efforts continue to scale to meet the growing demand for computer science educators, more individuals with little formal preparation in the discipline are seeking training. For this reason, it is important to understand the kinds of questions that these teachers, along with administrators and IT staff, are asking professional development providers. This research examines questions received by Scalable Game Design (SGD), a project that engages students in computing through game and simulation design activities. SGD has provided training for more than 300 teachers since 2009. We have found several dimensions of interest in the question pool. The major categories of questions received are pedagogical, technical, and procedural, and we present a generalizable taxonomy of question types plus specific examples. In addition, question content and questioner roles fluctuate throughout the professional development and classroom implementation cycle, from initial inquiries to requests regarding next steps. Knowledge of these factors can lead to adjustments in training content to reduce questions later on and potentially increase teacher confidence; moreover, this information can inform planning for support resources, an especially important activity when project growth is forecast. We also discuss how our support structures have changed over the life of the project and compare them to two other curriculum initiatives that rely on unique software environments. Our future work will investigate the characteristics of teachers who are asking particular kinds of questions, including their disciplinary backgrounds, experience in the classroom, familiarity with SGD, and instructional environments.},

Thus, we introduce in this article the GameBot ZoAm, developed for the Discord instant messaging and social platform. ZoAm offers a unique learning experience centered around storytelling, focusing on fundamental computing concepts and logical challenges that enhance computational thinking skills. Furthermore, the game also promotes an appreciation for Amazonian culture and folklore, with decision-making with human values. An action research study was conducted involving students from the last years of the end of elementary school. The research utilized a heuristic analysis based on the Gameplay Heuristics (PLAY) by Desurvire and Wiberg (ANO) and the evaluation model proposed by Korhonen and Koivisto (ANO) for mobile devices. The analysis employed a reduced and merged set of heuristics from these models, suited for the GameBot's context, focusing on (I) usability, (II) gameplay and immersion, and (III) mobility. Regarding the reliability coefficient used to evaluate the survey applied to students after playing the GameBot, Cronbach's Alpha and Guttman Lambda-6 (G6(smc)) coefficients were applied. These metrics were chosen to ensure the internal consistency and reliability of survey items, reflecting on how effectively the questions measured the focuses proposed by the heuristic analysis. The findings indicate that the game has the potential to facilitate the assimilation of the integrated concepts and sustain student interest throughout gameplay.},

abstract = {In this poster, we describe a theoretical model aimed at developing future human computational thinking in students. We describe a blended pedagogy drawing approaches from multiple disciplines such as social sciences, design, ethics, and computing to develop a new undergraduate introductory programming course. We describe how we introduced this pedagogy in an introductory programming course, taught in a university in India and summarise our preliminary findings.},

abstract = {This poster describes the "Computer Science for All Bulldogs (CS4ALL-B) pilot, a 7-week long course taught in Fall 2013 at Opelika Middle School, located in the Auburn- Opelika, Alabama Metropolitan Area (https://cs4allb.eng.auburn.edu). The program marks the first time a formal Computer Science (CS) course has been taught in an Alabama middle school. The CS4ALL-B curriculum builds upon the Auburn University innovative 'three-step' model of K-12 computing and robotics instruction that introduces CS and Computational Thinking (CT) concepts for K-12 students. This model uses programming frameworks such as Kodu, Alice, App Inventor, Lego NXT-G and Tetrix, and Computer Science Unplugged (CSU) activities. While moving between the three steps, students explore the fundamentals of CS/CT concepts. The CS4ALL-B curriculum is structured in four main sections: First, introduction to Kodu for 7th graders and Alice for 8th graders; Second, introduction to CS/CT Concepts; Third, participation in selected CSU activities, then students develop their programs to demonstrate their abilities to design and create Kodu or Alice worlds that implement the concepts learned while participating in CSU activities; Fourth, students build their own course project that includes all concepts and skills grasped throughout their training. This model helps maintain high levels of motivation, concentration, and engagement during the entire course. The results of the pilot assessment, including tools such as traditional written assessments (e.g. quizzes, tests) as well as alternative assessments tools (e.g. projects and blog posts), will be presented. We have found that our methods foster the learners' nascent development in CS.},

abstract = {Game design is often considered a motivational approach to get young children interested in programming and computational thinking. However, while the idea of game programming may be compelling from an educational point of view, creating games with interesting interactions that are actually fun to play remains challenging. Modern tools aimed at novice programmers should empower their users to create games, such as Pac-Man, that approach or even exceed the gameplay of 1980's arcade games. By adding a high-level AI pathfinding block to the RULER.game tool, 13 students in grades 1-4 attempted to build Pac-Man-like games. The findings suggest that all students were able to create Pac-Man-like games with compelling gameplay interactions, including ghosts finding the shortest path through complex mazes to Pac-Man, multiple ghosts collaborating with each other, and sophisticated game world topologies featuring toroidal portals.},
