abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) is becoming a common topic within the computing K-12 curricula worldwide. While much of the focus of research is on the use of Generative AI in and for education, AI as a core subject area is still gaining popularity, with much of this research focusing on content and tools that effectively support the teaching of AI. However, as we grow as a field, there is a need currently unmet to provide foundations (in the form of a block model as there exists for programming) to allow researchers to build strong pedagogies and methodologies from, and even a base to design activities and content. Compounding this, as ethics and its relationship to AI in the K-12 classroom grows stronger, there is a further need to provide scaffolding to educators and researchers not only on traditional AI concepts, but also on how they link with ethical knowledge, skills and dispositions. In this paper, the Human Centered Artificial Intelligence (HCAI) Block Model is developed and introduced. This is a competence-based model to guide effective teaching and learning of Human Centered Artificial Intelligence, as well as research in the K-12 space. The HCAI Block model’s foundation is developed/adapted from the programming Block model and has been adapted and developed using two lenses. The first was through the data science lens through interaction with Computational Thinking 2.0 and competency-based learning. The second lens was through a human-centred lens. The outcome was a ground-up K-12 model where traditional and technical AI concepts have been developed from the start, integrating ethical considerations and human-centred approaches.},

abstract = {Recent years have seen increasing awareness of the need to engage young learners in computational thinking (CT). Integrating digital storytelling, where students create short narratives, and CT offers significant potential for promoting interdisciplinary learning for students; however, it is critical to provide both teachers and students with automated support. A promising approach for enabling support is to leverage advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), which have demonstrated considerable potential for assessing both programming and natural language artifacts. In this work, we investigate the capabilities of LLMs to automatically assess student-created block-based programs developed using a narrative-centered learning environment that engages upper elementary students (ages 9 to 11) in learning CT and physical science through the creation of interactive science narratives. Using the narrative programs created by 28 students, we explore the efficacy of LLMs to assess the programs across two dimensions.},

abstract = {Training computer scientists to address wicked problems means to focus respectively on the individual capability to think in a computational-oriented way (i.e., Computational Thinking), and on the social dimension of coding (i.e., Agile Values). In this study we propose the conceptual model of Cooperative Thinking, a new education construct of team-based computational problem solving. Cooperative Thinking is not only the sum of Computational Thinking and Agile Values, rather it is a new overarching competence suitable to deal with complex software engineering problems. We suggest to tackle the Cooperative Thinking construct as an education goal, to train new generations of software developers to Pareto-optimize both their individual and teaming performances.},

abstract = {Developing student interest is critical to supporting student learning in computer science. Research indicates that student interest is a key predictor of persistence and achievement. While there is a growing body of work on developing computing identities for diverse students, little research focuses on early exposure to develop multilingual students’ interest in computing. These students represent one of the fastest growing populations in the US, yet they are dramatically underrepresented in computer science education. This study examines identity development of upper elementary multilingual students as they engage in a year-long computational thinking curriculum, and follows their engagement across multiple settings (i.e., school, club, home, community). Findings from pre- and post-surveys of identity showed significant differences favoring students’ experiences with computer science, their perceptions of computer science, their perceptions of themselves as computer scientists, and their family support for computer science. Findings from follow-up interviews and prior research suggest that tailored instruction provides opportunities for connections to out-of-school learning environments with friends and family that may shift students’ perceptions of their abilities to pursue computer science and persist when encountering challenges.},

abstract = {Computing education is becoming increasingly important in high schools. Computational modelling is important in computing and many sciences, but there is a lack of research on how teachers should teach computational modelling in high schools. This study was a design-based research study with 86 teachers teaching 12 different subjects at 44 Danish high schools. The study aimed to develop a template to help design and classify didactical questions on computational modelling. Teachers participated in one of two courses on computational modelling. The intervention group (Prog+) included an introduction to agent-based modelling and programming in NetLogo. The comparison group (Prog-) included a general introduction to agent-based modelling. A template consisting of 16 modelling parameters was developed with teachers. Results showed that the template was helpful for teachers to design didactical questions and for the research team to classify the taxonomical levels of these questions. A total of 51 teaching activities were developed by teachers and didactical questions were derived. The strength of this design based research study was that it included a control group and inspired teachers to design and evaluate didactical questions in computational modelling in a wide range of high school subjects. Future studies are needed to evaluate the validity of the template.},

abstract = {This lightning talk describes our current efforts to isolate and identify potential threshold concepts and threshold capabilities which are experienced by intermediate computer science undergraduate students. We are utilizing the theoretical framework as described by Meyer, Land, Bowden, and Baillie. Two of the key identifiable characteristics surrounding a threshold concept are (1) the transformation one undergoes as a result of incorporating the concept into their knowledge and (2) the state of uncertainty (liminality) experienced as the learner develops this understanding. As a result of this transformation and the resultant traversal of a liminal state, elements of an identity are often developed. For the computer science undergraduate, we hypothesize that advanced computational thinking skills are developed along with these transformations leading to the development of a computer scientist identity. Through identification of the threshold concepts/capabilities experienced by intermediate students the potential corollary concepts behind computational thinking may be uncovered as well. The overall project intends to integrate elements of threshold concepts, liminality, and transformative learning to produce a framework through which computational thinking can be probed and students' progression can be better assessed and supported. These efforts are only beginning - curious faculty and students are invited to attend our presentation and consider potential collaborative participation in our endeavors.},

abstract = {This paper shares the analysis of our quantitative findings regarding the impact of a virtual informal collaborative experiential learning activity on diverse students' computational thinking, critical thinking, and self-efficacy in STEM activities. Designed as part of an ongoing National Science Foundation sponsored project to provide underrepresented minority (URM) students from underserved economic backgrounds with real-world career preparation and technical education across disciplines through collaborative project activities using cutting-edge technologies, the Hackathon for Social Good was implemented during the COVID-19 shutdowns in a New York City community college in lower Manhattan. Students worked in teams to innovate practical solutions to global problems with mentor support from both academia and the tech industry. This intervention drew 36 students from Computer Science, Business, and Sociology classes, who worked with volunteers and alumni during a full-day event in the Fall of 2021, using AI and data science to design culturally sensitive data-driven solutions for real-world problems. The tracks covered the following topics: Zero Hunger, Clean Water, and Sanitation, Green Consumption, Racial Justice, Quality Education, Good Health, and Well Being. The two main objectives of this project are as follows: (1) Design a remote interdisciplinary one-day experiential collaborative learning environment to engage URM teams of students from a community college in applying computational thinking to develop solutions for social good. (2) Conduct research on our intervention to study its effect on students' self-efficacy, as well as their knowledge of, and comfort with, computational thinking, critical thinking, problem-solving, and STEM. The evidence gathered from qualitative and quantitative data indicates that using these mechanisms to infuse CT into student learning across disciplines has several positive outcomes. Students reported increased leadership skills, comfort with teamwork, problem-solving, and critical thinking. A quantitative study specifically showed a positive impact on student confidence in their ability to do CT and improved their sense of efficacy in impacting the world outside of the hackathon.},

abstract = {Learning trajectories are paths that students may follow in order to achieve their learning goals. Although the literature has addressed the subject, little has been done in the way of exploring how to visualize learning trajectories. In this paper, we present three forms of interactive learning trajectories visualizations linked to the context of computational thinking. As the interactions on visualizations involved different aspects, our proposal comprises three layers: the data representation, the reactions to the navigation and data exploration where more details of the data can be seen. Due to visualizations being tightly related to the context from which the data comes, we analyzed the data types available in Code.org, a well-known platform commonly used to teach computational thinking. To assess the three visualizations, we carried out usability and user experience evaluation with 23 Brazilian elementary schools teachers. The results revealed that the three visualizations achieved an average of 72\% of overall understanding by the audience. Besides, our findings showed the visualizations were well accepted among the participants. We also found out that the user experience reported by the participants is in some way associated with the level of understanding of the visualizations.},

Such a challenge may tie to socio-cultural issues that have impacted K-12 CS education, eventually creating a gender gap in CS performance and attitudes. The current study compared American and Indonesian middle school students' computational thinking (CT) skills and CS attitudes. Concurrently, this study also examined whether the items in the instruments we used exhibit country, gender, or prior CS experience measurement biases. A total of 592 American n = 242 and Indonesian n = 350 middle school students took a CT assessment and CS attitudes scale. Differential item functioning (DIF) was used to detect biased items, and a two-way ANOVA was utilized to examine the interaction effects of country and gender in the two constructs. The results showed some items were flagged as having country-specific DIF. The results also indicated that the American students had higher CT scores than Indonesian students. However, Indonesian students obtained higher CS attitudes scores compared to American students. Further results showed a significant gender difference in CS attitudes in the American samples; however, such a significant difference was not found in the Indonesian sample. These findings underscore the importance of a country's socio-cultural context in influencing gender diversity in the CS field.},

We add to this literature by examining whether or not there is a relationship between receiving CS instruction and students' academic performance in non-CS subject areas. Using a fixed-effects regression methodology with course-taking records from New York City, we examine the association between CS instruction and course grades for high school students. We find small positive associations between CS instruction and end-of-year grades in English, Math, Science, and Social Studies.},

However, some students can still need some guidance during the learning process due to the highly open-ended nature of these environments. Intelligent Pedagogical Agents (IPAs) can be used to provide personalized assistance in real-time to alleviate this challenge. This paper presents our results in evaluating such an agent deployed in a real-word free-form GD learning environment to foster CT in the early K-12 education, Unity-CT. We focus on the effect of repetition by comparing student behaviors between no intervention, 1-shot, and repeated intervention groups for two different errors that are known to be challenging in the online lessons of Unity-CT. Our findings showed that the agent was perceived very positively by the students and the repeated intervention showed promising results in terms of helping students make fewer errors and more correct behaviors, albeit only for one of the two target errors. Building from these results, we provide insights on how to provide IPA interventions in free-form GD environments.},

abstract = {As computing technologies continue to have a greater impact on daily life, it becomes increasingly important for the K-12 education system to prepare students for the computerized world. In this paper, we present the curriculum design, implementation, and results from a one-trimester introductory Python course that is mandatory for all 8th graders in our school district. This course is a crucial component of the K-12 computational thinking pathways we are developing at our school district, which take students from block-based programming and computational thinking (elementary school) to text-based programming and applications of computer science (high school). Our mandatory 8th grade course serves as a bridge between these two components. We present qualitative results that highlight the challenges that arose from teaching a course for all students -- not just those with a prior interest in computing -- and how the instructor overcame those challenges. We also present quantitative results that demonstrate the course's positive impact on students' attitudes towards computer science, their intent to re-engage with computer science in the future, and the gender gap with regards to confidence in computer science.},

abstract = {North Salem Central School District (North Salem) has worked with researchers as part of a larger Research Practice Partnership (RPP) to design and implement an inclusive PK-12 computing pathway in their district. This poster describes how teachers used Generative AI (GenAI) tools in three areas: (1) the development of sample computational thinking (CT) lesson plans; (2) initial brainstorming; and (3) professional learning.As North Salem reflected on their use of GenAI tools, they named two AI tools specifically: OpenAI's ChatGPT-4 and Bing's Image Creator. Teachers also describe ethical dilemmas that they faced when integrating GenAI tools as well as other concerns that will be described below. This work builds on the growing literature on the use of Generative AI tools to support the day-to-day work of teachers.},

abstract = {Abstract:At present, educational researchers are continuously exploring new ways of learner models. To solve the problems of data bias and feature mismatch that may occur in learner modeling on heterogeneous data, this paper uses the method of Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) to accurately portray the features of learners' thinking skills and construct a classification model for top talents. First, by analyzing the thinking skills that have the greatest impact on top talents, the features of critical thinking skills, logical thinking skills and computational thinking skills are extracted separately. Then, a learner classification model for top talents was constructed by MKL method. Finally, the model was validated on the dataset and compared with the results of single-kernel learning. The experimental results show that the accuracy of the classification model for top talents based on MKL is significantly better than that of ordinary single-kernel learning, which indicates that the method of MKL performs better in the learner classification model.},
