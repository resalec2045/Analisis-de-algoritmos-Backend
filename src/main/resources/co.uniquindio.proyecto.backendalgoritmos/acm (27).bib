abstract = {The rising interest of educators, researchers, and policymakers around the world as far as the development of computational thinking skills in compulsory education is concerned is echoed in the plethora of research studies discussed in the pertinent literature. However, the successful injection of computation thinking in formal educational settings demands the construction of developmentally appropriate assessment tools. In this paper, we discuss a novel framework for assessing computational thinking skills in early childhood settings. The proposed framework was employed in a relevant quantitative research study conducted in the city of Heraklion, Crete, from February to June 2019, with a sample of 435 first and second graders and within the context of the Environmental Study course. This paper also provides evidence regarding the examination of age, gender, and learning achievements in the Environmental Study course as predictive factors of one of the core computational thinking competencies, namely algorithmic thinking. The research findings revealed that age and learning achievements in the Environmental Study course constitute predictive factors for algorithmic thinking skills in the first and second grade level of primary school. On the contrary, algorithmic thinking skills are not related to first and second graders’ gender. The results of this study provide a solid background for designing and implementing developmentally appropriate tools for cultivating and assessing computational thinking skills in the early years of schooling.},

abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) is considered a necessary skill for the 21st century. Researchers have increasingly focused on how to effectively enhance students’ CT in programming courses. This study proposes a progressive scaffolding approach with flowcharts and visual programming codes applied to a visual programming course based on an open-source hardware platform to improve CT skills and self-efficacy in middle school students. Forty-five middle school students in grades 7 and 8 participated in this study. Both quantitative and qualitative data were collected by using CT tests, scales, and semi-structured interviews. A repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) examined differences in CT skills and self-efficacy on the pre-test, mid-test, and post-test. The results indicated that the progressive scaffolding approach significantly improved middle school students’ CT skills and self-efficacy. These results reveal the effectiveness of the progressive scaffolding approach in improving the computational thinking of middle school students in a visual programming course with an open-source hardware platform, which helps to extend the design of progressive scaffolding.},

abstract = {As efforts to incorporate Computer Science (CS) and Computational Thinking (CT) into K-12 classrooms continue to expand, there is a growing need for programs that prepare teachers for the effective teaching and integration of CS and CT into their instruction. An ongoing challenge is preparing current and future teachers to develop the skills and confidence needed to teach and integrate CS and CT. Micro-credentials, designed as a short, focused course, offer opportunities for teachers to build skills and confidence through targeted study. This experience report examines a self-paced online micro-credential developed and implemented within a university-based college of education. The micro-credential was designed to equip both pre-service and in-service teachers with the skills and knowledge necessary to teach and integrate CS and CT into K-12 teaching and learning. We describe the micro-credential, including its structure, sequencing, and content. We then present an exploration of teachers' experiences in the micro-credential. Findings from surveys and CS autobiographies show increases in participants' attitudes, beliefs, and perceptions toward the conceptual and technical aspects of teaching CS, with a particular focus on designing clear and actionable plans for integration. The results from this study provide valuable insights for the development of future CS- and CT-focused micro-credentials.},

abstract = {As Computational Thinking (CT) continues to permeate younger age groups in K-12 education, established CT platforms such as Scratch face challenges in catering to these younger learners, particularly those in the elementary school (ages 6-12). Through formative investigation with Scratch experts, we uncover three key obstacles to children’s autonomous Scratch learning: artist’s block in project planning, bounded creativity in asset creation, and inadequate coding guidance during implementation. To address these barriers, we introduce ChatScratch, an AI-augmented system to facilitate autonomous programming learning for young children. ChatScratch employs structured interactive storyboards and visual cues to overcome artist’s block, integrates digital drawing and advanced image generation technologies to elevate creativity, and leverages Scratch-specialized Large Language Models (LLMs) for professional coding guidance. Our study shows that, compared to Scratch, ChatScratch efficiently fosters autonomous programming learning, and contributes to the creation of high-quality, personally meaningful Scratch projects for children.},

abstract = {Coding for computer programming is a common way to support and assess computational thinking (CT) skills, a set of problem-solving skills essential for computer science (CS) and STEM more broadly. We designed a coding platform, Fox and Field, to determine what kinds of scaffolds can encourage novice coders to behave more like experts. We compared actions between 221 upper-division undergraduate CS/engineering (expert, n=106) and social science (novice, n=115) majors randomized to scaffolding conditions from four universities in the United States. Overall, experts used statistically significantly more practices aligned with CT skills, such as those that increased code efficiency (e.g., non-right angle turns, loops). This difference disappeared when novices were scaffolded by being told to use fewer codes or by priming with critical features. Both experts and novices were equally likely to be swayed by purposefully distracting features within the platform, such as a drawn path to deflect them from the most efficient solution. Results present initial evidence regarding which features of coding platforms can direct students to exercise CT-linked practices, leading to recommendations regarding platform development to better support learning.},

We investigated the tradeoffs between remote and co-located collaboration through a tangible coding kit. We asked ten pairs of mixed-visual ability children to collaborate in an interdependent and asymmetric coding game. We contribute insights on six dimensions - effectiveness, computational thinking, accessibility, communication, cooperation, and engagement - and reflect on differences, challenges, and advantages between collaborative settings related to communication, workspace awareness, and computational thinking training. Lastly, we discuss design opportunities of tangibles, audio, roles, and tasks to create inclusive learning activities in remote and co-located settings.},

Students were given the educational task of modeling protein synthesis in NetLogo. The design was a concurrent mixed-methods study. The study was situated in a constructivist and embodied cognitive perspective. The objective of the study was to develop a taxonomy table of gestures versus elements of computational thinking. Results showed a significant difference in the distribution of gestures across five concepts of computational thinking. Students used gestures adaptively in order to learn concepts of computational thinking. The findings indicate that students benefit from participating in a learning community where gesturing is seen as an important means of engaging with computing. The taxonomy is a first step towards linking computational thinking concepts with gestures as a means of better understanding student's engagement with computing.},

However, developing effective adaptive programming tasks can be challenging, particularly when it comes to selecting the appropriate changes and adapting the difficulty of the exercise. In this paper, we propose a model for tracking student knowledge and adapting programming exercises to guide the selection and implementation of task features. Our model combines aspects of cognitive load, computational thinking and feature-oriented software product line engineering to identify core and optional features, so that they can be used in conjunction to adapt to the specific needs and abilities of each student. We provide an overview over the insights gained from an exploratory study with students. To support the creation process of feature-based programming tasks, we present an approach using a template-based generator.},

abstract = {In this demo, I will present an activity that I use to introduce computational thinking in my non-majors course and outreach talks at high schools. I do this by first talking about what modeling and simulation are and why they are useful. Following this explanation, I introduce a variant of a problem about Alice and Bob. In the original problem, Alice and Bob take turns flipping a coin until one of them gets heads and wins. If Alice goes first, what is the probability that she wins? In class, I introduce this variant of the problem: "Bob suggests to Alice that they play a game. They will take turns flipping a coin until one of them wins by getting heads. The winner will then receive a dollar from the loser. If Bob says he will always let Alice go first, should Alice play the game?" While this problem is trivial for those comfortable with basic probability and familiar with geometric sequences, most of my students who are not computer science majors are not comfortable with math. Thus, I explain that although the problem can be solved with some math, instead we should first model the problem. Once we have modeled the problem, I have my students get some intuition by pairing off and having each pair play the game 20 times. I collect the results and discuss how so few trials are not sufficient to draw conclusions. Finally, I run a simulation that runs the game one million times and demonstrates that Alice should win 2/3 of the time and thus should play the game.},

While AI is currently a required part of computing curricula at universities, there are unique challenges in incorporating AI into K-12 education. The goal of BlueAI is to prepare K-12 educators to use game-based lessons to teach computational thinking, AI, and computer science skills that will interest children while incorporating important environmental and marine science subjects. We conducted assessments where we taught lessons at two different schools, and presented our findings.},

abstract = {While computational thinking has gained popularity in K-12 schools to increase access to computing tools and practices, there is still limited understanding on how to broaden participation of students with disabilities in computational thinking (CT). One approach to increasing access to computing to students with disabilities is to educate future special education teachers to bring CT into their instruction. This study examined the influence of integrating CT into assistive technology course for special education pre-service teachers. Our results suggest that integrating CT into special educa- tion teacher preparation coursework can have a positive impact on how pre-service teachers see the value of bringing computational practices to students with disabilities.},

abstract = {There is a growing need for 21st-century workers to be digitally literate and to possess computational thinking and collaborative problem-solving skills. Computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) focused on computational thinking can guide students toward the co-development of these skills. In this work, we present our approach to integrating virtual and physical learning modalities into InfuseCS, a CSCL environment. InfuseCS uses problem-based learning scenarios to situate upper elementary school students (ages 8 to 11) in a CSCL setting to foster their computational thinking and science knowledge construction as they collaborate to create digital narratives.},
