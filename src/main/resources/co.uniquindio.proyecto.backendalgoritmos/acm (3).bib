abstract = {Computational, logic thinking and problem-solving skills are extremely important for students' success in the future. This poster describes a collaborative project that was conducted to promote K-8 Computer Science Education among in-service and pre-service teachers. More than 40 pre-service and in-service teachers participated in a learning experience designed to address the K-12 Computer Science Framework and Maryland's K-12 Computer Science Standards. The collaboration was designed to facilitate participants' learning about and application of foundational principles of computer science and computational thinking into K-8 STEM curriculum and teaching. Participants explored hard/software platforms and used open source sites such as Scratch, Code.org and Code Academy. Participants envisioned how activities apply to K-8 classrooms and worked in pairs or groups to design a problem-based project for students. Project evaluation included formative and summative assessments to examine changes in content and pedagogical knowledge.},

abstract = {This poster provides an overview of the goals and objectives of the New York City Department of Education's (NYCDOE) Hack League, a district-wide competition that invites middle and high school students with any level of CS experience to explore the systemic impacts and applications of computing. By requiring participants to interact with data and prototype a proposed solution to an issue that the data illuminates, students creatively engage in a human-centered design and strategic problem-solving process aimed at improving the quality of life and civic issues in their communities. Each stage of competition represents a component of the engineering design process, thereby encouraging students to be thoughtful programmers. Through three stages of competition, students identify an issue and validate it with data, outline and prototype a solution while incorporating feedback from industry professionals and subject matter experts, and build metrics into their product. Making open data accessible to students has proven to be an effective approach to developing citizen scientists in NYC. This competition could be replicated in districts anywhere in the country and can be organized within or across schools. It is a great way to encourage student development as civic-minded individuals, engagement with their local government and elected officials, and application of computational thinking and computer science skills.},

In this study, we address two pertinent questions: (1) What types of artifacts do students develop across different disciplines in response to CT-driven problem prompts' and (2) What types of CT skills do these artifacts demonstrate? To answer the questions, we examined 273 artifacts developed by undergraduate students across seven course assignments from four disciplines: mathematics, sociology, music, and English using a rubric developed to evaluate the following CT skills: abstraction, decomposition, data analysis, and algorithmic thinking. We found that a range of skills were reflected across student artifacts.},

abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) is seen as one of the core elements fostered in STEM education, and many countries prepare and implement curricula for its development. Researchers realize that the development of CT in students at the elementary and middle school levels not only enables earlier use of CT, but also can better solute the problems in their daily learning. This study investigated the impact of self-directed learning on the development of CT in a block-based programming course. Using Pre- and posttest quasi-experimental research method, 128 students from a middle school were selected. Through the CT skill scale, the CT self-efficacy scale, and semistructured interviews, the quantitative and qualitative data were analyzed after four months of interventions. The findings revealed that the self-directed learning had a positive impact on middle school students’ CT skill and self-efficacy. Therefore, results revealed that self-directed learning is one of the effective learning strategies for developing CT of middle school students.},

abstract = {Computational Thinking has become an important cognitive skill to develop in all areas of education. Despite its increasing popularity, the construct itself is only partially understood. There are few measures currently in place that advance our understanding of computational thinking and its subconstructs. In this article, we analyze existing measures of computational thinking (CT), looking specifically at their measures of decomposition. Decomposition is defined as the process of breaking down a problem into its sub-components. Even though most definitions of computational thinking include decomposition, fewbreak down the decompositional process beyond a basic definition. As one of the first steps in the computational thinking process, it is important to better understand the various manners in which decomposition occurs, which methods are most effective, and under what conditions. To better understand the decompositional process, we analyze evidence of decompositional process in a variety of disciplines. We then present a framework for decomposition in computational thinking. We demonstrate how this framework may help educators to better prepare students to break down complex problems, as well as provide guidance for how decompositional ability might be measured.},

We present pilot instantiations of computational thinking integration in three different disciplines including sociology, mathematics and music. We also present our professional development approach, which is based on faculty support rather than a co-teaching model. Further, we discuss formative assessment during the pilot implementation, including data focusing on undergraduate students' understanding and dispositions towards computational thinking. Finally, we reflect on what worked, what did not work and why, and identify lessons learned. Our work is relevant to higher education institutions across the nation interested in preparing students who can utilize computational principles to address discipline-specific problems.},

CT skills can be instrumental in many subjects, which makes the integration an opportunity for learning CT but also for deepening subject specific learning. This study focuses on language arts, in particular English as a second language. It investigates digital storytelling as a way to integrate CT, analyzing its impact on students’ learning both of English and of CT, and on students’ attitudes toward the CT integrated English lesson. A class of 8th grade students (average age 13 years) participated in the study. The impact of the CT integrated lessons was investigated using students’ final products, surveys, rubrics, exit tickets and focus group interviews. The results suggest that the digital storytelling approach may improve students’ learning of English and of CT, and that it helped enhancing students’ creativity and collaboration, thus promoting their digital participation.},

abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) has been recognized as an important part of K-12 education in many countries and is often described in term relating to computer science both in concepts and context. However, the unique practice of computer scientists collaborating on problem solving is often overlooked in CT education in high school. We believe that collaboration is a key aspect of modern computing, and propose to integrate collaborative CT activities into existing high school education. The aim is to prepare students better for exploring computational approaches to high school disciplines as they are practiced in the professional world. Our research question is: how can we design tools for supporting students' collaboration while teaching CT in high school? A new computational environment, CoTinker, has been developed. The tool uses a cross-device approach and foster students' verbal communication and collaboration in groups. The tool was tested in a Biology class. Students' computational thinking (CT) was assessed through learning activities and students' communication was analyzed by audio recordings, of students, imbedded in CoTinker and by focus group interviews with students. Preliminary findings showed students being able to collaborate and solve CT tasks in groups independent of teacher or researchers. Results also indicated that students were able to use, navigate, and critically reflect upon the CoTinker environment.},

abstract = {Teachers new to computing who are not familiar with technical “jargon” can feel like they have landed in a foreign world, making them reluctant to take on the subject, and potentially leading to misconceptions and misunderstandings in the classroom. The diversity of technical words, metaphors, and phrases in different contexts can make their meanings confusing, ambiguous or misunderstood for the diverse user groups in computing education. Therefore, understanding the nature of the commonly claimed difficulties and confusion caused by computer jargon among teachers becomes important for finding ways to address this issue. This paper presents the findings of an empirical study conducted to understand the nature of teachers’ understanding of computational terms (jargon) related to Computational Thinking concepts, and how a relevant professional development intervention can help to resolve issues related to them. The results indicate that the nature of the teachers’ understanding of computational terms can be either that the computational meaning is not known, that the computational context is unclear, or their applicability is unclear. Concerns about teachers finding computer jargon difficult to understand can be because the computational context in which they are applied makes them difficult for teachers to understand, rather than not knowing their meanings in the first place. Moreover, appropriate support can enable teachers to learn the techniques and skills that the terminology refers to.},

Even though these are crucial areas in today’s world, they are only rarely taught in school and interventions that target these areas simultaneously are still very rare. We therefore developed a four-day workshop with the aim of fostering computational thinking and social-emotional skills in Grade 4 students. To do so, we used the child-friendly programming language Scratch. In the present paper, we investigate the feasibility of such a workshop. In total, 18 students participated. Data was collected via observation and interviews and analysed by qualitative content analysis. Results showed that students liked working with Scratch and liked working on social-emotional challenges. The workshop was found to work well and students worked independently. Pair work activity was found to be particularly beneficial. Although some issues initially proved challenging (mostly relating to “how to” issues in Scratch), these may easily be addressed by making suitable adaptations to the introduction of the program provided on Day 1 of the workshop.},

abstract = {There is a growing focus on computational thinking (CT) in terms of supporting children’s understanding of everyday technologies. But unlike other technologies, Augmented Reality (AR) has received limited attention. In this paper, we present ExposAR – a collaborative cross-device AR system enabling children to create, use, and reflect on AR technologies through the co-creation of a simple AR application. With ExposAR, we explore three core design principles: 1) reify computational concepts, 2) support collaborative cross-device authoring, and 3) incorporate the user’s own world. These principles were developed through a co-design process with teachers and evaluated with 46 primary school students. We found that the collaborative authoring process with ExposAR supported students in understanding AR concepts and challenged their perspectives on AR. With these results, we bring AR to the CT agenda and contribute novel design principles for exposing the underlying mechanisms and implications of AR.},
