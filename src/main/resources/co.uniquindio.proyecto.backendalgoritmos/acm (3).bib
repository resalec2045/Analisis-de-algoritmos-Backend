abstract = {This paper describes a research-practice partnership (RPP) in western South Dakota involving twenty 4th and 5th grade teachers and a support team of university researchers and K-12 learning specialists. For three years, the RPP has been exploring ways to strengthen computational thinking within elementary math and science instruction, attending to policy considerations and the local education landscape. The RPP is motivated in part by the hypothesis that a larger, more diverse group of students will choose to enroll in computer science courses in high school if they gain familiarity and confidence related to computational concepts at earlier grades. Feedback from participating teachers along with student attitude and problem-solving data suggest this is a promising approach.},

abstract = {Virtual reality (VR) technology has been widely used in many industries. Therefore, the cultivation of virtual reality technology talents is imminent. However, there are relatively few universities that carry out virtual reality courses. At the same time, the virtual reality course is a good carrier to cultivate computational thinking. It can improve students ' problem-solving ability, creativity and teamwork ability, which are also necessary to cultivate computational thinking. Computational thinking, as a necessary basic skill for talents in the 21 st century, needs to be improved in the training approach of college teaching. However, there are relatively few teaching approachs to cultivate computational thinking through virtual reality (VR) courses. Based on this, this study constructs a design-based STEM+VR teaching approach, which combines the interdisciplinary knowledge of STEM education with VR subject knowledge, aiming to cultivate college students ' computational thinking through virtual reality courses. In this study, a single group of pre-test and post-test experiments were conducted to investigate the complex ability of computational thinking of a college student in Wuhan, including five sub-dimensions:creativity,algorithmic hinking, collaborative ability, critical thinking and dimensional problem solving.The research shows that after the design-based STEM + VR teaching, the abilities in the sub-dimension of computational thinking are significantly improved. The design-based STEM + VR teaching case provided in this study is expected to provide some reference for the use of virtual reality courses to cultivate computational thinking in college education.},

abstract = {In the educational setting, consolidating computational thinking (CT) and digital literacy (DL) as two important skills for 21st- century professionals have become more important than ever. Nonetheless, scientific literature on both topics has rarely focused on developing frames of reference that offer incorporation of the interweaving of these skills. The objective of this document is to analyze and discuss the relationship between CT and DL in a framework where technology is used for education, with the end goal of designing a conceptual proposal that shows its common elements. The result is an initial proposal of interweaving that addresses skills such as abstraction (critical/cognitive-informational-communication), algorithm design (critical/cognitive-informational), and communication as common components, among others. We concluded that this proposal must be discussed, broadened, and considered as an initial reference framework for further analyses and delving into the topic.},

abstract = {Due to the increasingly computational nature of professions, computational thinking (CT) is of growing importance to authentic science learning and the education of future scientists. To meet this need, CT integration is expanding within classrooms. We provided professional development (PD) for pre-service and in-service teachers focused on integrating CT into elementary science. At the PD culmination, 36 teachers wrote and enacted 22 unique CT-integrated science lessons, individually or with teaching partners. Waterman et al. (2020) suggested three levels of integrating CT within lesson plans: exist, labeling already present CT; enhance, adding CT components; and extend, adding activities supporting science learning with CT. Using this framework, we examined these lesson plans, their alignment to CT practices, and the level of CT integration. Our results indicated 83.3\% of teachers successfully integrated CT within their lessons, focusing on Using Data, Computational Simulations, and Programming practices. Further, we found the level of integration differed by CT practice. Data practices generally led to exist level integration, Computational Simulation practices to enhance level integration, and Programming practices tended to extend science lessons or exhibit the science topic with Programming. Our data demonstrated teachers can write CT-integrated lesson plans, but all levels of integration are not equal opportunities for authentic scientific learning. As the field seeks to offer equitable and quality CT experiences for all students integrated within disciplinary subjects, we must understand the level of CT integration and consider how different levels of integration could affect opportunities for students.},

abstract = {With the development of the digital age, online teaching and learning is becoming more widespread in schools around the world. In the online teaching environment, the teaching mode of the course is an important element that receives attention in education and teaching. The online teaching mode based on the cultivation of computational thinking can improve students' learning interest and cultivate their innovative thinking ability. However, the author found through educational internship that there are problems such as single teaching activities, lack of teacher-student interaction, poor cooperative learning, and short independent learning time in high school information technology classrooms, which lead to low computational thinking ability and are not conducive to the development of students' innovative ability. The development of students' computational thinking ability is a requirement put forward by the high school information technology curriculum to secondary school students, and the improvement of computational thinking can help students adapt to the future society and meet the demand of future innovative talents. Therefore, this study takes high school students as the research object, under the guidance of constructivism and cognitivism theories, adopts survey research, experimental research and other research methods to construct and verify the online teaching mode based on the cultivation of computational thinking in high school information technology courses. The results of the study show that the online teaching mode based on the development of computational thinking can effectively improve students' algorithmic, evaluation, decomposition, abstraction and generalization thinking abilities, and thus enhance the online learning effect.},

abstract = {Students who receive special services in mathematics or neurodiverse learners (NDLs) deserve to learn mathematics at a rigorous and equitable level as their peers. Yet, many of these students are not reaching proficiency. Computational thinking (CT) may function as a bridge between students' mathematical learning and their everyday lives. We argue that computational thinking is a pathway for NDLs to follow that will bridge the connections between math instruction and the real-life problems with which NDLs are eager to engage. We identified the critical elements needed to support rural special educators' integration of CT into math instruction by identifying intersections between CT, Math, and the assets of NDLs, as well as barriers to implementation. By leveraging connections from an existing RPP (Research-Practice Partnership), which focuses on CS education and Business intersection in rural Maine schools, we created an opportunity for participatory research for special educators and paraprofessionals often overlooked in these processes. We employed a multi-method, design-based research (DBR) approach. Through observational, survey, and interview data, we found that 1) educators are not currently receiving support for integrating CT in special education classrooms, 2) activities piloted by our educators were well received by students, 3) current standards and Individualized Educational Plan (IEP) requirements for NDLs are a significant barrier to implementation. The need for expanded, regular PD for special educators is evident, as is the potential for CT as a bridge for mathematical understanding for NDLs.},

abstract = {Nature connection fosters children's healthy development, and long-term sustainable behaviours. Most research into children-nature connection has focused on positive experiences. However, theories of constructive hope suggest that as well as imbuing a love of nature we should also help children understand environmental challenges. Computational thinking is a skillset that might help young children frame and address complex problems. This skillset is currently exclusively developed indoors using technological devices and indoor activities. Our research explored an opportunity to develop young children's computational thinking skills through nature play. An observation and contextual inquiry study was conducted with young children in an Early Childhood Education Centre. We found that computational thinking is evident in children's outdoor nature play and that HCI research could undertake design to further enhance their computational thinking skills outdoors. This can add value to their learning by harnessing their interest, understanding and connection, and by introducing children to environmental problem-solving.},

We present the exploration of a craftsmanship-driven approach to engage people in CT. To explore this approach a team of knitters, a computer scientist and a computing education expert iteratively designed the KnitxCode workshop. KnitxCode utilises knitting in combination with CT concepts as the foundation for the activities. The workshop was evaluated by 12 participants with no programming experience and with knitting experience ranging from 2-25 years (M = 6). From the evaluation we found that the craftsmanship-driven approach seemed to provide the participants with confidence to learning CT, as shared concepts and practices between knitting and computing supported transitioning from knitting craftsmanship to computing and in this way served to demystify computing.},

abstract = {As computational thinking (CT) becomes increasingly acknowledged as an important skill in education, self-directed learning (SDL) emerges as a key strategy for developing this capability. The advent of generative AI (GenAI) conversational agents has disrupted the landscape of SDL. However, many questions still arise about several user experience aspects of these agents. This paper focuses on two of these questions: personalization and long-term support. As such, the first part of this study explores the effectiveness of personalizing GenAI through prompt-tuning using a CT-based prompt for solving programming challenges. The second part focuses on identifying the strengths and weaknesses of a GenAI model in a semester-long programming project. Our findings indicate that while prompt-tuning could hinder ease of use and perceived learning assistance, it might lead to higher learning outcomes. Results from a thematic analysis also indicate that GenAI is useful for programming and debugging, but it presents challenges such as over-reliance and diminishing utility over time.},

However, how can this emerging technology benefit the development of skills, such as Computational Thinking (CT) and Design Thinking (DT), through a meaningful process of imagining, designing and tinkering with objects that could be used in real-world problems? Our knowledge is still limited, due to the complexity of designing 3D printable models from scratch with the existing digital tools. This paper discusses a web-based tool that enables learners to create and dynamically manipulate the behavior and properties of 3D printable models with high-level programming. This design aims to foster computational thinking, creativity, and design thinking skills as it focuses on the design process of the model, its behavior and its usage after printing. It also presents the results of a pilot study in which secondary school students engaged in a Design Thinking project for designing and printing sustainable everyday objects using this design. The study revealed new kinds of educational potential of 3D printing including the understanding of complex mathematical and CT ideas that were too complicated before, and the connection of CT practices with real-world problems through the implementation of a Design Thinking project with digital media.},

This study presents a preliminary literature review of 71 peer-reviewed articles on CT. The papers indicate the existence of five main aspects that have historically been used in association with its definition: Algorithm, Abstraction, Modelling, Simulation, and Implementation. Based on this preliminary literature study, semi-structured interviews with eight CT scholars are conducted, in order to evaluate these aspects and to identify qualitatively different perspectives on CT, which integrate the mentioned aspects in different ways. From the interviews, three different perspectives emerged, focusing on: Reasoning, Simplification, and Automation. Furthermore, the goal of having computationally educated citizens is extrapolated from the interviews, indicating an additional perspective (+1) titled Empowerment, which appears as embedded within all the previous three perspectives. This paper proposes to put these three (+1) perspectives in dialogue, in an effort to support researchers and practitioners working with CT across different fields.},

abstract = {This study analyzed the relationship between computational thinking (CT) and coding attitudes of upper elementary students after exposure to a year-long CT curriculum. Using ordinary least squares regression and controlling for student demographics (i.e., gender and English Learner (EL) status), we found that CT skills were a significant factor in modeling coding attitudes, regardless of demographic controls. Interviews of the students unveiled an interaction between coding interest and social values in a debugging process.},

abstract = {Adaptive support can help learners in Open-Ended Learning Environments (OELEs), where the free-form nature of the interaction can be confusing to students. In this paper, we design and evaluate an Intelligent Pedagogical Agent (IPA) for an OELE designed to foster Computational Thinking (CT). Specifically, we design help interventions for an in-the-wild scenario where students interact with the OELE in an unmonitored, self-directed manner. We build a student model by extracting meaningful student behaviors on real-world interaction data obtained during interaction in online classrooms and including expert insights. We show that these student models perform better than a baseline and have the potential for adaptive support in self-directed interaction with the OELE. We design an IPA with the help of teachers, leveraging the student behaviors extracted from data. Lastly, we get insights into the value of these help interventions by empirically evaluating the IPA in a formal user study.},
