abstract = {Background
Surgical scheduling is pivotal in managing daily surgical sequences, impacting patient experience and hospital resources significantly. With operating rooms costing approximately US $36 per minute, efficient scheduling is vital. However, global practices in surgical scheduling vary, largely due to challenges in predicting individual surgeon times for diverse patient conditions. Inspired by the Toyota Production System’s efficiency in addressing similar logistical challenges, we applied its principles as detailed in the book “Lean Thinking” by Womack and Jones, which identifies processes that do not meet customer needs as wasteful. This insight is critical in health care, where waste can compromise patient safety and medical quality.
Objective
This study aims to use lean thinking and Toyota methods to develop a more efficient surgical scheduling system that better aligns with user needs without additional financial burdens.
Methods
We implemented the 5 principles of the Toyota system: specifying value, identifying the value stream, enabling flow, establishing pull, and pursuing perfection. Value was defined in terms of meeting the customer’s needs, which in this context involved developing a responsive and efficient scheduling system. Our approach included 2 subsystems: one handling presurgery patient data and another for intraoperative and postoperative data. We identified inefficiencies in the presurgery data subsystem and responded by creating a comprehensive value stream map of the surgical process. We developed 2 Excel (Microsoft Corporation) macros using Visual Basic for Applications. The first calculated average surgery times from intra- or postoperative historic data, while the second estimated surgery durations and generated concise, visually engaging scheduling reports from presurgery data. We assessed the effectiveness of the new system by comparing task completion times and user satisfaction between the old and new systems.
Results
The implementation of the revised scheduling system significantly reduced the overall scheduling time from 301 seconds to 261 seconds (P=.02), with significant time reductions in the revised process from 99 seconds to 62 seconds (P<.001). Despite these improvements, approximately 21% of nurses preferred the older system for its familiarity. The new system protects patient data privacy and streamlines schedule dissemination through a secure LINE group (LY Corp), ensuring seamless flow. The design of the system allows for real-time updates and has been effectively monitoring surgical durations daily for over 3 years. The “pull” principle was demonstrated when an unplanned software issue prompted immediate, user-led troubleshooting, enhancing system reliability. Continuous improvement efforts are ongoing, except for the preoperative patient confirmation step, which requires further enhancement to ensure optimal patient safety.
Conclusions
Lean principles and Toyota’s methods, combined with computer programming, can revitalize surgical scheduling processes. They offer effective solutions for surgical scheduling challenges and enable the creation of a novel surgical scheduling system without incurring additional costs.}

Across studies, the positive relationship between individual differences in cognitive sophistication and skepticism toward BS was stronger among people who ascribe high (vs. low) value to being epistemically rational. Moreover, experimentally reducing people's ability to engage in analytic thinking (by inducing cognitive load) reduced skepticism toward BS among individuals who ascribe high value to being epistemically rational. By contrast, skepticism toward BS was equally low in the no-load condition as under cognitive load among people who ascribe low value to epistemic rationality (Study 2). We also demonstrate that cognitive sophistication, coupled with ascribing high value to being epistemically rational, predicts skepticism toward BS, regardless of the source's credibility (Study 3).}

Existing measures of PT are limited by demand and expectancy effects, cognitive biases, and reflexivity, leading to calls for unobtrusive, behavioral measures. In response, we developed a behavioral measure of PT based on language. A mixed sample of 188 participants with major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, or no psychopathology completed self-report PT measures. Participants were also interviewed, providing a natural language sample. We examined language features associated with PT, then built a language-based PT model and examined its predictive power. PT was associated with multiple language features, most notably I-usage (e.g., “I”, “me”; β = 0.25) and negative emotion language (e.g., “anxiety”, “difficult”; β = 0.19). In machine learning analyses, language features accounted for 14% of the variance in self-reported PT. Language-based PT predicted the presence and severity of depression and anxiety, psychiatric comorbidity, and treatment seeking, with effects in the r = 0.15–0.41 range. PT has face-valid linguistic correlates and our language-based measure holds promise for assessing PT unobtrusively. With further development, this measure could be used to passively detect PT for deployment of “just-in-time” interventions.}

The results demonstrated various strategies in specializations and generalizations in terms of mathematical thinking skills while solving robotics problems. In this framework, "noticing symmetry", "finding a relationship between angle and direction of rotation", "noticing obtuse angles, acute angles”, and “noticing the change of sign when changing the direction of angles” were found prominent strategies in the specialization dimension. The strategies of "finding solutions compatible with the problem", "using algebraic operations", and "making calculations" were found prominent in the generalization.

abstract = {Background
Suicide is the second-leading cause of death among adolescents and is associated with clusters of suicides. Despite numerous studies on this preventable cause of death, the focus has primarily been on single nations and traditional statistical methods.
Objective
This study aims to develop a predictive model for adolescent suicidal thinking using multinational data sets and machine learning (ML).
Methods
We used data from the Korea Youth Risk Behavior Web-based Survey with 566,875 adolescents aged between 13 and 18 years and conducted external validation using the Youth Risk Behavior Survey with 103,874 adolescents and Norway’s University National General Survey with 19,574 adolescents. Several tree-based ML models were developed, and feature importance and Shapley additive explanations values were analyzed to identify risk factors for adolescent suicidal thinking.
Results
When trained on the Korea Youth Risk Behavior Web-based Survey data from South Korea with a 95% CI, the XGBoost model reported an area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve of 90.06% (95% CI 89.97-90.16), displaying superior performance compared to other models. For external validation using the Youth Risk Behavior Survey data from the United States and the University National General Survey from Norway, the XGBoost model achieved AUROCs of 83.09% and 81.27%, respectively. Across all data sets, XGBoost consistently outperformed the other models with the highest AUROC score, and was selected as the optimal model. In terms of predictors of suicidal thinking, feelings of sadness and despair were the most influential, accounting for 57.4% of the impact, followed by stress status at 19.8%. This was followed by age (5.7%), household income (4%), academic achievement (3.4%), sex (2.1%), and others, which contributed less than 2% each.
Conclusions
This study used ML by integrating diverse data sets from 3 countries to address adolescent suicide. The findings highlight the important role of emotional health indicators in predicting suicidal thinking among adolescents. Specifically, sadness and despair were identified as the most significant predictors, followed by stressful conditions and age. These findings emphasize the critical need for early diagnosis and prevention of mental health issues during adolescence.}

abstract = {Critical thinking is often described as purposeful, reflective judgment, encompassing both skills and disposition components. Are critical thinking and fluid intelligence distinct capabilities, or do they rely on similar cognitive processes? Extensive research indicates that executive functions, which govern the cognitive control of complex, goal-oriented behavior, play pivotal roles in both critical thinking and fluid intelligence. This current study delves into the degree of overlap between critical thinking and fluid intelligence, exploring how three frequently cited executive functions—updating, inhibition, and shifting—predict each of these faculties and their overlap. Data were gathered from a sample of 232 university students (142 female; Mage = 19.70, SD age = 1.22) on measures of critical thinking skills, critical thinking dispositions, fluid intelligence and executive functions. The findings reveal that fluid intelligence exhibits a significant association with both critical thinking skills (r = 0.62) and critical thinking dispositions (r = 0.31). Furthermore, the functions of updating and inhibition significantly contribute to both critical thinking skills and fluid intelligence, jointly explaining 85 % of their common variance. However, executive functions did not emerge as significant predictors of critical thinking dispositions. These results contribute to our deeper comprehension of human intelligence by elucidating the distinctions and associations between critical thinking and fluid intelligence, while shedding light on their underlying cognitive mechanisms.}

Therefore, this paper integrates human thinking experience into actual collision avoidance decision-making to propose an intelligent collision avoidance model that is more in line with the operator ‘s understanding, thus improving trustworthiness and autonomy. The general architecture of collision avoidance model is divided into two modules: a basic model and an analytical model, by adopting from human thinking patterns of fast and slow. The basic model considers the COLREGS and navigation experience to solve the encounter situation of two ships. The analytical model addresses the collision avoidance issues in complex scenarios with multi-ships, by introducing the repulsive force and the driving force parts of the social force model, which are used to implement course mapping adjustment and gentle course fluctuation respectively. Additionally, a field theory-based effect evaluation model is designed to blend human experience with algorithmic benefits for making the optimal decision in complex scenarios. The results show that when the basic model and the analytical model work together, this architecture performs effectively in a variety of scenarios. It is worth mentioning that the collision avoidance model can potentially be developed to advance collision-free and human-like process trajectory navigation in multi-ship situations.}

Apart from its direct applications, computation signifies a concept about soft data management that was developed well before computers were introduced into practice. An interest in malleable patterns guiding design during late modernism was suggestive of alternative methods responding to socioecological aims. Patterns were no longer rigid geometric references imposed upon a scheme, but ones supporting complexity, mutation and evolution as in a bio-systemic context. These earlier endeavours may set the intellectual framing of recent advancements in computing, promoting architectural thinking as a comprehensive model of cross-scientific action in analogy with nature's synergistic functions.}

Across two studies (N = 506 and N = 161) participants completed Gc tests of vocabulary knowledge and were divided into low, medium, and high Gc groups. They also completed two alternate uses task, to assess verbal creativity, and a semantic fluency task, to estimate semantic memory networks. Across both studies, the semantic memory network structure of the high Gc group was more flexible—less structured, more clustered, and more interconnected—than that of the low Gc group. The high Gc group also outperformed the low Gc group on the creativity tasks. Our results suggest that flexible access to semantic memory supports both verbal intelligence and creativity.
Educational relevance statement
Crystallized intelligence (Gc)—knowledge acquired through education and experience—supports creativity, yet whether Gc contributes to creativity beyond providing access to more knowledge (semantic memory), remains unclear. In this two-part study, we find that individuals with higher Gc tended to have a more flexible semantic memory structure, which in turn supported greater verbal creativity. This finding suggests that building students' vocabulary knowledge and verbal skills may not just expand their knowledge base, but also increase creativity through enabling more flexible access to that knowledge. If supported by further research, this could mean educational interventions targeting growth in Gc and semantic flexibility may foster students' creative capacities beyond just improving content mastery. Overall, this research highlights the interplay between building domain knowledge and cultivating creative thinking, suggesting educators should aim to develop both abilities in tandem rather than treating them separately.}

In this review, we summary the cultural aspects of CT, specifically studies involving the Remote Associates Test (RAT), considering variations in RAT versions, thinking styles, and control strategies. Additionally, we performed summary from the brain activation patterns of C-RAT and E-RAT to support our propositions. We proposed a theoretical framework that differs from previous conclusions, which suggested that CT and DT are independent sub-components of creativity and that CT only benefits from persistence. Variations observed among different RAT sets may partially explain differences in creative performance. Western individuals benefit from a bias towards flexibility, facilitating the formation of more distant and weaker associations to promote CT. Eastern individuals, on the other hand, prioritize the usefulness of solutions and tend to engage in a holistic thinking style to foster CT. The common neural activation across cultures supports the partial reliance of CT on flexibility, while the additional activation observed only in E-RAT can be attributed to individual's cognitive effort to suppress close thoughts in order to form remote associations, and reach a unique solution by the evaluation of potential candidate ideas.}

Bifactor analyses supported the existence of an underlying general factor of rational thinking processes as well as specific facet factors. Construct validity was analyzed with reaction times of correct and incorrect responses to test and control items. Among students (n = 191), rational thinking predicted academic success beyond fluid intelligence.

This paper presents the development of a comprehensive and detailed rooftop Solar Index framework incorporating the DVF framework of Design Thinking that includes the principles of User Desirability, Technological Feasibility, and Business Viability for the process development. The developed index framework segregates the variables that categorize the rooftop sector into 3 drivers, 5 sub-drivers, and 20 parameters that are linked to multiple indicators of interest. The chosen variables of interest have been validated using Co-relation coefficient analysis and the weights have been assigned by Domain Experts or Specialists using Modified Borda's Technique & Analytical Hierarchical Process. The index has also been used to compare the performance of two chosen states across India & highlight a few key bottlenecks. The developed index is of critical importance to access the performance of the rooftop solar sector & could be used by multiple stakeholders like policymakers, investors, consumers, and entrepreneurs to ensure a wide proliferation of rooftop solar PV technology.}

This study aims to systematically review and analyse the literature by taking a holistic approach to previous studies in order to clearly identify the gaps in the field and the steps to be taken for future studies. In this context, two different analysis methods were employed in the study. This review aims to reveal information that has not been fully captured or evaluated previously, including information related to important sources, documents, countries, and keywords used in the field. According to the results obtained from the study, the country with the highest publication performance is the United States of America, and the most cited publication source is the Journal of Thinking Skills and Creativity. The most frequently studied concepts in the documents are identified as 21st century skills, assessment, creativity, learning, teaching, teacher, education, and primary school. Another result obtained reveals that articles on critical thinking, which increased between 2015 and 2020, mostly discussed critical thinking in the fields of mathematics and science education. Studies that examine the development of critical thinking skills through the implementation of different teaching methods are particularly in the majority. According to the analysis results of the article methodologies, it is revealed that the majority are based on the qualitative research approach, the criterion sampling method is used with small sample groups, and the most preferred data collection tool is the document. In addition to revealing the current status regarding the research tendencies of critical thinking in primary education, these results have the potential to guide researchers, countries and primary school teachers working in the field.}

abstract = {In the context of digital transformation, educators are seeking ways to guide students to become innovative technology designers. However, students often lack innovative problem-solving skills when working with IT, and so new pedagogies are needed to improve IT-related curricula. Design thinking (DT), as a methodology, may offer the potential to meet this need. The present study developed a DT-based framework for the design of IT learning projects. A quasi-experiment was conducted in a junior middle school, employing both qualitative and quantitative analysis methods to explore the impact of DT on learning outcomes and mechanisms that explain the observed changes in student performance. The findings demonstrate that DT promotes creativity in students’ digital works, especially their value, diversity, and originality. DT also enhances students’ awareness of using IT to address daily challenges and facilitates their basic information knowledge and skills. Regarding the mechanisms, the DT process and tools serve as learning scaffolds and facilitate the creativity of digital work. The Ideate of DT generates ideas on what to do and how to do it. Empathize and Define establish a link between digital work and real-life problems. Prototype and Test help students acquire basic information knowledge and skills. This study not only examines the impact of DT on IT education but also explores the mechanisms to explain the observed changes in learning performance. The findings can serve as a guide for educators and researchers to further optimize the teaching of IT courses and nurture innovative talents required in the new era.}

From the perspective of life-history theory, we propose that mortality reminders may induce backward thinking from the endpoint of life and regulate intertemporal choice between smaller-and-sooner (SS) and large-and-later rewards (LL), thereby helping individuals with time management. Experiment 1 compared the effects of mortality (endpoint) imagination with the imagination of being at age 70 and found that only mortality imagination significantly reduced delay discounting, the extent to which a delayed reward is discounted. In Experiment 2, mortality reminders companied by retrospective episodic mental time travel significantly reduced delay discounting compared to prospective episodic processing. However, the effect disappeared when the end-of-life reminder was replaced with an old-age (70 years) reminder. Highlighting the inevitability of death, coupled with retrospective episodic thinking, promoted future-oriented preferences, suggesting that end-of-life meditation is likely to induce retrospective mental time travels.}

Moreover, the complex characteristics of urban morphology and microenvironmental data at the street-block scale impact the speed of quantitative calculations of the energy demands of buildings. Intelligent spatial design workflows, driven by artificial intelligence tools and evolutionary algorithm-based self-feedback mechanisms, have been developed to address these issues. In constructing performance-driven simulation workflows for space generation, architectural simulations are influenced by model accuracy, boundary conditions, and application limitations. These problems have different solutions according to the study scope or focus; hence, the proposed solutions are specific and limited. Currently, numerical simulations in the design phase are based on detailed physical models such as EnergyPlus. However, existing algorithms are not tailored for data-driven generative design, which requires the quantification of limited information and has high computational costs, limiting the ability to balance simulation accuracy and computational costs. In this paper, bibliometric analysis is applied to systematically investigate the application of technical methods in energy consumption analyses in the early stage of architectural design. The applicability of forward- and reverse-simulation workflows in performance analyses of environmental systems is analyzed considering differences in the data flow direction. Additionally, considering the data limitations in the design phase, the accuracies of detailed physical models and simplified engineering models in performance-driven architectural space generation workflows are compared. Furthermore, optimization methods, common algorithms, and plugins and their advantages and disadvantages are summarized.}

The test requires participants to name ten nouns that exhibit maximum dissimilarity from each other. The semantic distance between these nouns is then calculated to indicate the person's level of divergent thinking. In this study, we explored the applicability of the DAT for elementary school students in Chinese contexts, given that it was not initially designed for this specific population and was available only in English. We recruited a total of 348 students who were asked to complete three creativity tasks: the DAT, the Alternative Uses Task (AUT), and the Bridge-the-Associative-Gap Task (BAG). We examined the associations between DAT and the scores of the AUT and BAG tests. Moreover, we tested the accuracy of the DAT using varying numbers of nouns and different natural language processing models to calculate the semantic distance between nouns. Our findings supported the suitability of using the DAT to measure divergent thinking in elementary school students within Chinese contexts. We also found that using only eight nouns, instead of ten, could achieve a relatively high accuracy in measuring divergent thinking based on the DAT method. The language model of Word2Vec performed better than the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) models when calculating semantic distances between nouns. This study has methodological and practical implications.}

The method used in this study is the quasi-experiment method. In this study, researchers used learning with augmented reality to find its effect on student learning outcomes in grade 8 junior high school, which has an average age of 13 years. The research design used in this study was a quasi-experimental nonequivalent control group design. This study, 2 sample classes were taken: an experimental class (learning with augmented reality) and a control class (learning without augmented reality). The experimental and control classes have the same characteristics; each has 20 male and 20 female students. The instrument used in this research is a geometric thinking ability test. This study uses a test instrument in the form of essay questions. The instrument was given twice, namely during the pretest and post-test. There are ten essay questions made. After obtaining the data from the pretest and post-test results, the normalized gain score formula (N-Gain) was used to know the increase in geometric thinking skills. The N-Gain result of the experimental class is 78% or 0.78, which is in the high category. Whereas in the control class, it was 50% or 0.58, this result is in the moderate category. The N-gain results show that there is a difference between the experimental class and the control class. In this case, the effectiveness of using augmented reality for learning geometry in junior high school students is higher than those who did not receive augmented reality treatment. From the N-gain value, it proves that learning using augmented reality learning media is effective in increasing the ability to think Geometry. Then the results of observations made during learning activities using augmented reality show that students look active and make students more enthusiastic when learning Geometry. The results of the responses showed that 39 students had become more proactive in learning Geometry by using augmented reality applications.}

Instructors who adopted an evaluative stance responded by providing examples or explaining how to solve the problem, often taking on the intellectual work of solving the problem. Instructors who adopted an interpretive stance responded by providing examples or asking guiding questions informed by the student’s thinking. We then extended our analyses to illustrate two instructional archetypes (Interpreter and Evaluator), to highlight how the stance taken when examining student work can serve as a proxy for how instructors engage with student thinking more broadly.}

Previous studies on the factors influencing CTD in undergraduate students yielded inconsistent results, often examining these factors based on raw scores without considering plausible values (PVs) which can unbiasedly provide estimates that are closer to the truth. This study aims to explore the factors (e.g., gender, year of study, major, parents' educational level, family income, residence, and type of university) that potentially influence undergraduate students' CTD using PVs. This study involved 661 Chinese undergraduate students (female students represented 50.4%), utilizing the Employer–Employee–Supported Critical Thinking Disposition Inventory for data collection. After calculating PVs using item response theory, linear regression models through dummy variable regression on the PVs were conducted. The findings revealed that when the factors were examined individually, CTD may vary by type of university, year of study, parents’ educational level, and family income. However, when the factors were integrated into a comprehensive robust regression model, family income was identified as the unique factor influencing CTD, indicating that individuals from higher-income families exhibited higher CTD levels than students from lower-income families. Demographic factors accounted for 5%–10% of the variation. Future research should investigate additional factors that may substantially impact on college students’ CTD. It is crucial for educators to acknowledge the disparities in CTD prevalence based on family income and devise an effective way to promote CTD among individuals from low-income backgrounds.}

The case study outlines key elements of learning design and explores the implementation of a project tailored for 13-14-year-old students. A thematic, theory- and data-driven analysis examined the challenges and opportunities in the in-situ and post-reflections of the teacher and researcher-teacher (Noora, the first author) on pedagogical practices and the teacher's role. Three intertwined themes emerged: design leader, collaboration and co-teaching, and (co-)reflection.

The article also advocates for the necessary mindset and skillset of teachers, emphasizing the importance of professional development and collaboration in enhancing the quality of school-based design and maker education.

For a common test of DT, the Alternate Uses Task (AUT), the primary automated approach casts the problem as a semantic distance between a prompt and the resulting idea in a text model. This work presents an alternative approach that greatly surpasses the performance of the best existing semantic distance approaches. Our system, Ocsai, fine-tunes deep neural network-based large-language models (LLMs) on human-judged responses. Trained and evaluated against one of the largest collections of human-judged AUT responses, with 27 thousand responses collected from nine past studies, our fine-tuned large-language-models achieved up to r = 0.81 correlation with human raters, greatly surpassing current systems (r = 0.12–0.26). Further, learning transfers well to new test items and the approach is still robust with small numbers of training labels. We also compare prompt-based zero-shot and few-shot approaches, using GPT-3, ChatGPT, and GPT-4. This work also suggests a limit to the underlying assumptions of the semantic distance model, showing that a purely semantic approach that uses the stronger language representation of LLMs, while still improving on existing systems, does not achieve comparable improvements to our fine-tuned system. The increase in performance can support stronger applications and interventions in DT and opens the space of automated DT scoring to new areas for improving and understanding this branch of methods.}

Recently, a new measure of associative cognition has been developed—forward flow—which uses computational semantic models (e.g., latent semantic analysis; LSA) to capture “how far” people travel in semantic space during a chained free association task. The present research aims to extend the psychometrics of forward flow by 1) leveraging multiple computational semantic models for forward flow computation (reliability) and 2) testing how this metric of associative ability relates to divergent creative thinking (validity). In addition, using structural equation modeling, we test dual-process theories of creative cognition by examining the relative contribution of associative and executive abilities to divergent thinking. Study 1 (n = 151) finds moderately improved reliability of forward flow using the new multi-model approach (compared to LSA only), as well as positive effects of both forward flow (β = .48) and general intelligence (β = .36) on divergent thinking (human creativity ratings) in the same structural regression model. This pattern of results was replicated in Study 2 (n = 150), which showed large effects of forward flow (β = .42) and general intelligence (β = .46) on divergent thinking. The results expand the psychometrics of forward flow and provide new evidence for dual process models of creative cognition.}

To address this issue, this study proposes an optimized field synergy strategy using a front-tracking algorithm, which analyzes the heat transfer in segmented regions rather than the entire domain. Four LHS units with varying shell shapes are designed and experimentally validated. The melting performance shows that the upward case improves the melting performance and heat transfer intensity by 17.44 % and 21.56 % compared to the benchmark case. Further analysis using the field synergy principle (FSP) explores the synergy and matching degree. The results indicate that heat transfer is driven by the combined effects of different regions, with heat transfer near the tube wall and the solid-liquid front dominating. The FSP analysis indicates that the heat transfer mechanism is affected by the comprehensive effect of the synergy and matching degree. Specifically, the matching degree is more crucial when the shell shape changes. The upward case improves the matching degree by 29.95 % and 33.82 % near the tube wall and solid-liquid front, respectively. This study provides a novel analysis and optimization strategy for LHS systems with natural convection.}

To gain insights into the roles and challenges of researchers aiming to bridge the gap between open science and open innovation, a decade-plus Mapping Literature Review was conducted based on the complex thinking paradigm. Complex thinking allows for novel connections of the information collected through open science and open innovation, considering different forms of engaging with alternative means of knowledge creation that may promote innovative and critical thinking. The findings revealed: a) broad positioning of the terms in the European Union; b) open access and open data as current driving themes; c) a constant trade-off between the terms “open data” and “information protection”; d) lack of studies on researchers’ complex thinking to help them manage openness; e) absence of the environmental helix in the initiatives; and (f) challenges in innovative communication and collaborative practices among public and private entities. Overall, we identified an opportunity to develop researchers’ complex thinking such that the openness of information becomes a shared responsibility among partners across multiple helices. This shared responsibility can have methodological implications that permeate how open science and open innovation are theorized and, in practice, facilitate the development of fundamental collaborative research procedures.}

abstract = {Background
Critical thinking (CT) is an important 21st-century skill which enables individuals to actively use their knowledge and problem-solving skills to overcome life challenges. Educators, employers, and policymakers focus on CT skills to foster scientific thinking in education. In many countries, the development of CT skills has become a major component in education. CT skills training is offered to students based on the assumption that every student learns these skills in the same manner (i.e., homogeneity assumption). However, if heterogenous groups exist, accounting for this may provide more effective CT skills training.
Methods
Latent profile analysis (LPA) was applied to the Cornell Critical Thinking Test (CCTT) with middle school students from South Korea (N = 520), Turkey (N = 996), and the United States (N = 1,599), separately, to determine if CT subpopulations exist for each country. Generalizability of the latent profiles across countries were investigated through a multi-group LPA similarity assessment.
Results
Employing multiple fit criteria, a three-profile solution was identified for each country, and multi-group LPA analysis supported the similarity of the profiles across countries.
Conclusion
Similar CT skill profiles across countries suggest that interventions for developing CT skills may be appropriate across educational contexts. Further work is needed to understand the mechanisms behind a student's CT profile and inform interventions or curricula for fostering CT skills. Future directions and limitations were discussed.}

We used a quasi-experimental research design to evaluate the effects of this curriculum intervention, with 120 children enrolled in the experimental classrooms, while the other 111 children enrolled in the waitlist control classrooms. Teacher-report child performance (N = 231) showed that the MM program resulted in significantly higher scores in children's STEM habits of mind in the intervention group, relative to the control group. Analyses of parent-report child behaviors revealed that there was a significant effect of the MM program on post-intervention temperamental surgency. Our evidence shows that such a scalable program encourages and guides teachers to build a positive learning environment for supporting young children's making and thinking in everyday preschool experiences. The makerspace further sets a solid foundation for the development of children's STEM thinking skills and socioemotional skills in a rapidly changing digital society.}

The constructive episodic simulation hypothesis holds that the constructive nature of episodic memory enables us to retrieve and recombine details from disparate memories to simulate novel future experiences. Here we examine research supporting this link between memory and prospective thought. First, we review evidence that impairments in episodic memory and future thinking co-occur, and that both abilities rely on the default mode network. We discuss recent findings showing that episodic memory details are retrieved in service of future simulation, including evidence that modulating access to episodic details alters future simulation, and that multivoxel patterns of hippocampal activity can decode specific details comprising future simulations. Finally, we cover the neural substrates of emotional future thinking, given that the capacity to simulate emotional future events plays a role in goal-directed and reward-oriented behavior.}

Measures of these variables were administrated to both university students (n = 362) and middle school students (n = 247). The SEM results showed that metacognition made unique contributions to critical thinking ability even when working memory was controlled for. Further, there was no significant difference regarding the predictions from metacognition and working memory to critical thinking ability between the university and middle school students. Our findings provide a first step toward understanding metacognition as a distinct construct from working memory in relation to critical thinking ability.}

HDSTA provide guidelines on how different parties can work together to define a knowledge graph for the transportation system model.

Moreover, there are crucial limitations of previous approaches for addressing the sustainability challenge of the energy sector. Changing, transforming, and integrating paradigms are the most relevant leverage points for transforming a given system. In other words, nowadays the integration of new predominant paradigms in order to provide a unified framework could aim at this actual transformation looking for a sustainable future. This research aims to develop a new unified framework for the integration of the following three paradigms: (1) Sustainability, (2) Complexity, and (3) Systems Thinking which will be applied to achieving sustainable energy production (using hydrogen production as a case study). The novelty of this work relies on providing a holistic perspective through the integration of the aforementioned paradigms considering the multiple and complex interdependencies among the economy, the environment, and the economy. For this purpose, an integrated seven-stage approach is introduced which explores from the starting point of the integration of paradigms to the application of this integration to sustainable energy production. After applying the Three-Paradigm approach for sustainable hydrogen production as a case study, 216 feedback loops are identified, due to the emerged complexity linked to the analyzed system. Additionally, three system dynamics-based models are developed (by increasing the level of complexity) as part of the application of the Three-Paradigm approach. This research can be of interest to a broad professional audience (e.g. engineers, policymakers) as looks into the sustainability of the energy sector from a holistic perspective, considering a newly developed Three-Paradigm model considering complexity and using a Systems Thinking approach.}

Design-by-Analogy promotes divergent thinking, by studying solutions have solved similar problems and using this knowledge to make inferences and solve problems in new and unfamiliar situations. Bio-inspired design (BID) is a form of design by analogy and its knowledge provides diverse sources for analogy, making BID knowledge as a potential source for divergent thinking. Existing BID database has focused on collecting BID cases and facilitating the retrieval of biological knowledge. Despite its success, applying BID knowledge into divergent thinking still encounters challenge, as the association between source domain and target domain are always limited within a single case. In this work, a novel approach is proposed to support divergent thinking from three subsequent phases: encoding, retrieval and mapping. Specifically, biological knowledge is encoded in a triple form by employing a large language model (LLM) to extract key information from a well-known BID knowledge base. The created triples are implemented in a semantic network to facilitate bidirectional retrieval modes: problem-driven and solution-driven, as well as mapping for divergent thinking. The mapping algorithm calculates the semantic similarity between nodes in the semantic network based on their attributes in three progressive steps by following the paradigm of divergent thinking. The proposed approach is implemented as tool called AskNatureNet,11https://www.asknaturenet.com/. which supports divergent thinking by retrieving and mapping knowledge in a visualized interactive semantic network. An ideation case study on evaluating the effectiveness of AskNatureNet shows that our tool is capable of supporting divergent thinking efficiently.}

In the present study, participants (N = 338) were randomized to either the TDI or a control condition. A Bayesian modeling approach suggests positive and moderate effects. Moreover, those in the treatment were over twice as likely to make CRT gains than those in the control group. Additional mediation and moderation analyses were conducted to test whether the TDI impacts CRT via thinking dispositions such as need for cognition and intellectual humility, and/or whether such attributes meaningfully interact with the intervention. Thinking dispositions do not appear to mediate this relationship, neither do they moderate the effect of the intervention. Implications for dual process theory are discussed.}

A total of 4847 secondary school English learners (Mage = 15.579, SD = 0.546) from China participated in the research, with 46.1 % males and 53.9 % females. Data was collected through self-reported scales measuring perceived teacher enthusiasm, CT dispositions, and WTC. Findings revealed a positive association between CT dispositions and WTC, identifying systematicity, self-confidence in reasoning, inquisitiveness, and cognitive maturity as significant predictors of WTC. Moreover, teacher enthusiasm was found to positively moderate the relationship between CT dispositions and WTC. Additionally, high levels of teacher enthusiasm boosted WTC more significantly for students with high CT dispositions, and this effect was stronger for females than for males. This research carries significant implications for FL teaching, suggesting that fostering teacher enthusiasm and reinforcing CT dispositions could significantly elevate learners’ communicative willingness and overall language proficiency.}

Do accuracy prompts cause people to “stop and think,” increasing deliberation? Or do they change what people think about, drawing attention to accuracy? Since these two accounts predict the same behavioral outcomes (i.e., increased sharing discernment following a prompt), we used computational modeling of sharing decisions with response time data, as well as out-of-sample ratings of headline perceived accuracy, to test the accounts' divergent predictions across six studies (N = 5633). The results suggest that accuracy prompts do not increase the amount of deliberation people engage in. Instead, they increase the weight participants put on accuracy while deliberating. By showing that prompting people makes them think better even without thinking more, our results challenge common dual-process interpretations of the accuracy-prompt effect. Our findings also highlight the importance of understanding how social media distracts people from considering accuracy, and provide evidence for scalable interventions that redirect people's attention.}

Although the effects of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) are most obvious at clinical treatment failure, AMR evolution, transmission, and dispersal happen largely in environmental settings, for example within farms, waterways, livestock, and wildlife. We argue that systems-thinking, One Health approaches are crucial for tackling AMR, by understanding and predicting how anthropogenic activities interact within environmental subsystems, to drive AMR emergence and transmission. Innovative computational methods integrating big data streams (eg, from clinical, agricultural, and environmental monitoring) will accelerate our understanding of AMR, supporting decision making. There are challenges to accessing, integrating, synthesising, and interpreting such complex, multidimensional, heterogeneous datasets, including the lack of specific metrics to quantify anthropogenic AMR. Moreover, data confidentiality, geopolitical and cultural variation, surveillance gaps, and science funding cause biases, uncertainty, and gaps in AMR data and metadata. Combining systems-thinking with modelling will allow exploration, scaling-up, and extrapolation of existing data. This combination will provide vital understanding of the dynamic movement and transmission of AMR within and among environmental subsystems, and its effects across the greater system. Consequently, strategies for slowing down AMR dissemination can be modelled and compared for efficacy and cost-effectiveness.}

The intention is to argue whether there is a statistically significant difference in the acquisition and development of this competency between men and women of different ages during their training. Methodologically, a multivariate descriptive statistical analysis was carried out to demonstrate the relationship between these indicators. We concluded that there is evidence of a gender gap in developing the perceived achievement of the complex thinking competency and its sub-competencies since neither in the overall result nor in the specific results by indicator did women achieve results proportional to those of their male peers, although, in most competencies, they initially surpassed them. The learning experience shows that the gender gap in perceived achievement of complex thinking competency widens as the student population advances in their training process.}

Traditional skill learning methods cannot meet this demand, while complex learning can adapt to this demand for talent. In complex learning systems, various factors such as instructional theory, instructional interventions, and technology work together to facilitate the acquisition of complex thinking or operational skills. However, the effectiveness of instructional factors in complex skills learning remains unknown. To find out the effects of these factors on the acquisition of different complex skills, this meta-analysis includes 60 empirical studies and the effectiveness of 4C/ID model, instructional interventions and technical support on different complex learning are investigated. Complex skills learning had a moderate positive overall effect in acquiring complex skills: g = 0.67, 95% CI [0.49, 0.85]. Both thinking skills (g = 0.69, 95% CI [0.44, 0.94], k = 40) and operational skills (g = 0.64, 95% CI [0.38, 0.89], k = 20) showed moderate positive effects, and there was small but not statistically significant difference in the effect sizes between the two groups. Funnel plot, Egger's test and Rank Correlation Test results show that the findings were likely not to be affected by publication bias. We conclude that: compared to traditional learning, (1) the 4C/ID model is more suitable for thinking skills learning and has a significant large positive promotion effect. (2) Different instructional interventions can play a positive role in promoting the learning of complex skills. Learning scaffolding and learning platforms and tools are more suitable for operational skills learning, while thinking skills learning can benefit more from the adjustment of instructional models. (3) A variety of technologies can have a high effect on facilitating complex thinking and operational skills. These results show that different instructional interventions and technical support play a vital role in the learning of complex skills. In practical application, we need to make reasonable selection and application according to the specific educational situation and complex skills.}

abstract = {Educational research trends demonstrate a growing interest in understanding the impact of games on mathematics achievement. However, only a limited number of studies have synthesized previous quantitative studies to investigate how game-based learning (GBL) influences the enhancement of students' high-order thinking skills (HOTS) in mathematics. To address this gap, this meta-analysis study aims to investigate the effectiveness of GBL on students' mathematics HOTS. The study analyzed 40 effect sizes from 13 empirical studies published from 2010 to 2024, gathered from electronic databases such as Scopus, Eric, and Pro-Quest. R software was employed for analyzing effect sizes, detecting publication bias, and conducting subgroup analyses. Using the k-means algorithm, two studies identified as outliers were excluded. After removing these outliers, the findings revealed a positive effect of GBL on students' mathematics HOTS, with an overall effect falling within the small category (g=.134, p<.001). Additionally, moderator variables, including educational level, measured thinking skills, continent, control treatment, and intervention duration, significantly influenced the improvement of HOTS using GBL, while the sample size factor showed no significant impact. All findings, limitations, and implications are discussed in this article.
Resumen
Las tendencias de investigación educativa muestran un creciente interés en comprender el impacto de los juegos en el logro en matemáticas. Sin embargo, solo un número limitado de estudios ha sintetizado investigaciones cuantitativas previas para investigar cómo el aprendizaje basado en juegos (ABJ) influye en la mejora de las habilidades de pensamiento de alto nivel (HOTS) de los estudiantes en matemáticas. Para abordar esta brecha, se ha realizado un estudio de metaanálisis con el objetivo de investigar la efectividad del ABJ en las HOTS matemáticas de los estudiantes. El estudio ha analizado 40 tamaños de efecto de 13 estudios empíricos publicados desde 2010 hasta 2024, recopilados de bases de datos electrónicas como Scopus, Eric y Pro-Quest. Se ha empleado el software R para analizar los tamaños de efecto, detectar sesgo de publicación y realizar análisis de subgrupos. Utilizando el algoritmo k-means, se han excluido dos estudios identificados como valores atípicos. Después de eliminar estos valores atípicos, los hallazgos han revelado un efecto positivo del ABJ en las HOTS matemáticas de los estudiantes, con un efecto general situado dentro de la categoría pequeña (g=.134, p<.001). Además, se ha encontrado que variables moderadoras, incluido el nivel educativo, las habilidades de pensamiento medidas, el continente, el tratamiento de control y la duración de la intervención, han influido significativamente en la mejora de las HOTS mediante el ABJ; mientras que el factor de tamaño de la muestra no ha mostrado un impacto significativo. Se han discutido todos los hallazgos, limitaciones e implicaciones en este artículo.}

However, research has tended to focus upon end products and skill development, and little is known about creative development processes. This study sought to explore young children's creative processes as they engaged with three digital coding devices over an eight-week period as part of a Digital Discovery Program. It employed a microethnography to provide nuanced observations of five young children's (aged 4–5 years) interactions and behaviours. Data was collected through approximately 40 hours of video recordings, capturing the dynamic and multimodal aspects of the childrenʼs play and learning experiences. A multimodal interaction analysis was used to examine the multimodal design affordances of each device as mapped against Murcia et al.'s (2020) A-E of Creativity Framework. The findings revealed a clear interplay between digital technologies and various modes of communication, with children demonstrating creativity through their verbal expressions, manipulation of the devices, and spatial understanding of their physical environment. By understanding the multimodal affordances of digital devices aligned with educational frameworks and embracing child-specific definitions of creativity, educators, curriculum designers, policymakers, and researchers can collectively promote creativity and enrich digital learning and play for young children.}

Many organizations use video games in the fields of education, marketing, business, and entrepreneurship. This research aimed to investigate the role of video games in enhancing managers' strategic thinking and their potential contribution to developing cognitive capabilities. The sample included 30 students actively involved in the innovation and entrepreneurship ecosystem. To measure the strategic thinking of the participants, Pisapia’s strategic thinking questionnaire was used, and the CANTAB test was employed to measure their cognitive capabilities. To identify the individuals’ game-playing styles, indicators of micro-management, planning, plan recognition, predictions, gathering resources, partial observability, and damage avoidance were designed. The findings indicated that 53.3 percent of the participants had reflective thinking, 30 percent had systems thinking, and the rest had a reframing thinking style as their strategic thinking dominant dimension. On the other hand, given the identified correlation between the damage avoidance criteria with the thinking and reflective style, as well as the inverse and significant correlation of the gathering resources criteria with the results of the PRM test, it seems that strategic games have the potential to change and even develop some cognitive functions such as attention, reaction, and memory, and can be considered as tools to improve cognitive ability. These games can be used to design tasks to enhance managers' cognitive abilities and subsequently promote their strategic thinking and decision-making skills.}

The purpose of this study is to determine the impact of interactive learning on Zoom on the anxiety, emotional well-being, and critical thinking of college students. The experiment involved 80 college students between 18 and 21 years of age. The research was performed by scientists from the [Zhengzhou University of Technology] University. To analyze the impact of the proposed strategy on emotional and cognitive well-being, the study used a set of questionnaires, namely Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale, WAM (Well-being Assessment Measure), and Subjective Questionnaire for assessing critical thinking. The obtained results confirm the effectiveness of the interactive learning methodology, which significantly reduced anxiety and increased the level of critical thinking among students. Anxiety decreased by 14 points, and critical thinking improved by 2.5 points, indicating positive dynamics of psychological and cognitive development. Despite the positive results, some contextual factors such as the level of the learning environment, cultural characteristics, and the personalities of students can influence the generalization of the findings. These findings can have practical application in the pedagogical practice of creating a favorable learning environment. Future research may focus on improving the methodology of interactive learning, studying its impact on other aspects of learning and development. It is also necessary to explore the use of interactive learning in various cultural and educational contexts.}

In response to this, an urban decarbonisation framework which was informed by systems thinking was developed to support multi-level climate action and decision making. Another aim was to demonstrate the integration of a data-driven and activity-based GHG emissions model for individuals into the framework to enable decarbonisation. This model was populated using individual activity and lifestyle data which were collected for 172 people using a smartphone application. The resulting emissions drivers were identified as well as their interaction with the overarching urban decarbonisation framework. The research will have important implications in terms of informing emissions mitigation efforts at individual, community and urban scales. By applying the framework, individual data and GHG emissions modelled at scale can inform citizen and population-level actions and high-level emissions mitigation policy for accelerating the sustainability transition that our societies and cities must urgently undergo.}

These frameworks offer a robust methodology for tackling complex, dynamic, and interconnected challenges—referred to as “wicked problems”. In addition, this paper proposes a fourth-year engineering design course that explicitly incorporates these approaches, addressing the identified gap in social competencies within engineering education. By integrating these approaches into the foundation of engineering design education, there may be an avenue to equip engineers with the skills needed to empathize with stakeholders, understand contextual landscapes and generate meaningful solutions that contribute positively to society.}

We examined whether this persistency of negative thinking is related to current and future levels of depressive symptoms among adolescents. Persistency of negative self-referent thinking was assessed by means of a decision-making task, namely the emotional reversal learning task. This task offers participants the choice between thinking about negative and positive self-related aspects. Their choice for negative self-referent thinking is initially rewarded but is later punished. Therefore, participants were expected to efficiently switch between negative and positive self-referent thinking, and to internally update their reward expectancy for these thinking options. Results showed that persistency of negative self-referent thinking was related to concurrent levels of depressive symptoms, replicating earlier findings in adults. However, persistency of negative thinking was unrelated to future levels of depressive symptoms. These findings suggest that adolescents with depressive symptoms tend to hold on to the belief that negative self-referent thinking has beneficial consequences, even when it is no longer being rewarded. This tendency should be seen as a concurrent feature of depression, as the predictive value is still in question.}

Interest in this area has increased significantly in recent years, and an increasing number of firms employ this approach, especially in the early stages of the innovation process, in which context design thinking is used to gain insights into user needs and generate new ideas. However, empirical evidence regarding the timing and process associated with the deployment of design thinking during the three different phases of the innovation process (fuzzy front end, development and testing, and commercialization) remains very limited. This gap may hinder research and practical advancements regarding when and how to implement design thinking in the innovation process. We explore this problem through a case study of a leading Chinese technology firm in the refrigeration industry using a longitudinal lens. We show that when and how the firm uses the four design thinking practices—(1) user-centeredness, (2) embracing diversity, (3) visualization and (4) iteration—to enable a transition from the fuzzy front end to development and testing and ultimately to commercialize a new product. Moreover, our findings suggest that the firm needs to adapt to the changing innovation goals and dynamically adjusts the content and intensity of design thinking practices as the innovation phase progresses. These findings therefore offer practical guidance for managers adopting design thinking to promote innovation.}

The fourth class was used as a control class that learned math and music in a standard way without creative intervention. To collect the data, we developed software that enabled the students to perform musical and mathematical tasks that included questions with only one correct answer, and questions that invited original and varied answers that encouraged creative thinking. Pre‐ to post‐intervention analyses indicated that the experimental groups outperformed the control group on patterns of creative thinking in both math and music, regardless of the teaching focus. Combined instruction in creativity in the Math and Music class resulted in similar patterns of creativity in the two domains, suggesting that the creative thinking was transferable from one domain to another.}

The final model suggests that, in line with predictions, critical thinking mediates the relationship between the 21st century skills of cooperativity, digital literacy, creativity, algorithmic thinking, and problem solving.

Network science tools have recently been applied to map the organization of concepts in semantic memory, and to study the link between semantic memory and creativity. Yet such work has largely overlooked the domain of convergent thinking, despite the theoretical importance of semantic memory networks for facilitating associative processes relevant for convergent problem solving (e.g., spreading activation). Convergent thinking problems, such as the Compound Remote Associates (CRA) test, can be solved with insight (the sudden “aha” experience) or analysis (deliberately and incrementally working towards the solution). In a sample of 477 participants, we adopted network science methods to compare semantic memory structure across two grouping variables: 1) convergent thinking ability (i.e., CRA accuracy), and 2) the self-reported tendency to solve problems with insight or analysis. Semantic memory networks were constructed from a semantic fluency task, and problem solving style (insight or analysis) was determined from judgments provided during solving of CRAs. We found that, compared to the low-convergent thinking group, the high-convergent thinking group exhibited a more flexible and interconnected semantic network—with short paths and many connections between concepts. Moreover, participants who primarily solved problems with insight (compared to analysis) showed shorter average path distances between concepts, even after controlling for accuracy. Our results extend the literature on semantic memory and creativity, and suggest that the organization of semantic memory plays a key role in convergent thinking, including insight problem solving.}

Dysfunction in executive functioning processes, particularly the ability to regulate the contents of working memory, are implicated in the development and maintenance of RNT. Guided by the National Institute of Mental Health experimental therapeutics framework, this study aimed to investigate the cognitive effects and effects of two doses of a novel working memory training (WMT) intervention in individuals with elevated RNT across mood, anxiety, and traumatic stress disorders. We conducted a three-arm randomized controlled trial with 8-session and 16-session WMT interventions and a waitlist control group (N = 73). Our primary goal was to establish target engagement of WMT as measured by behavioral and neural indicators of working memory performance. Results revealed that WMT significantly improved working memory performance and resulted in reduced frontoparietal neural activity during a working memory task compared to the waitlist control group, providing evidence of target engagement. Exploratory analyses revealed a potential transfer of training effects to fluid intelligence, a construct related to but distinct from working memory, suggesting broader cognitive benefits of WMT. These data provide evidence that WMT can enhance working memory performance in individuals with RNT. This intervention holds promise as a transdiagnostic approach for ameliorating RNT-related clinical burden, with the 8-session regimen showing pragmatic advantages. Further research is needed to elucidate its impact on clinical symptoms and explore potential cognitive benefits beyond working memory.}

abstract = {Associative learning plays a central role in addiction by reinforcing associations between environmental cues and addiction-related information. Unsupervised learning models posit that memories are adjusted based on how strongly these representations are coactivated during the retrieval process. From a different perspective, clinical models of addiction posit that the escalation and persistence of craving may depend on desire thinking, a thinking style orienting to prefigure information about positive addiction-related experiences. In the present work, we tested the main hypothesis that desire thinking is a key factor in the strengthening of addiction-related associations. A group of adult smoking volunteers (N = 26) engaged in a period of desire thinking before performing an associative learning task in which neutral words (cues) were shown along with images (smoking-related vs. neutral context) at different frequencies. Two retrieval tests were administered, one immediately after encoding and the other after 24 h, to test how the recall of associations changed as a function of retention interval. Two control groups, smokers (N = 21) and non-smokers (N = 22), performed a similar procedure, with a neutral imagination task replacing desire thinking. Participants who engaged in desire thinking increased their performance from the first to the second retrieval test only for the most frequent smoking-related associations. Crucially, this selective effect was not observed in the two control groups. These results provide behavioral evidence in support of the idea that desire thinking plays a role in strengthening addiction-related associations. Thus, this thinking process may be considered a target for reconsolidation-based conceptualizations of, and treatments for, addiction.}

Interest in robotics usage to develop such competencies in educational settings arises but there hasn't been so far mapping of the research conducted in this field. Thus, we present a scoping review of 59 articles published from 2012 to 2023 in 4 Databases and 2 Registers examining kindergarteners' skills through Educational Robotics. Our goal was to map which skills are commonly examined in kindergarten and under which terminology as well as to investigate the studies' features, the types of robotics, and the assessment tools utilized. Our findings depict that several skills are evaluated using different terms. Critical thinking is examined most frequently, creativity the least, and communication is integrated into collaboration and the opposite. Most of the researchers used the mixed method focusing on qualitative tools, examining quite a small sample size, and conducting the intervention for a short time. Also: BeeBot, Lego robotics kits (WeDo, Mindstorms), and social, humanoid robots are often used. Additionally, the evaluation tools used in the reviewed papers are presented and categorized into groups. This scoping demonstrates that robotics might affect positively the children's cognitive skills and creativity but may not facilitate their interactions so much regarding emotional expressions. Moreover, a gap in quantitative research on kindergarteners' skills development via Educational Robotics is spotted. Finally, this scoping review suggests: creating clear terms for skills, developing robotics tailored to kindergarten age, forming full robotics activities, and designing modular evaluation tools for young learners' capacities.}

The studies were retrieved from both English and Persian indexing sources such as Google Scholar, Noormags, Civilica, and the Scientific Information Database (SID). Thus, the gray literature was not included. The risk of bias in this systematic review was considered and computed. This review followed the fixed stages of the statistical systematic review, and 77 effect sizes out of 53 published studies were identified. After eliminating seven outliers, 70 studies were included in the meta-analysis (N = 9,120). The findings uncovered that CT and EFL learning had a remarkable relationship in Iran. The results covered that language proficiency is complex and requires further investigation and distinct L2 learning-related skills were moderators among the included studies. Based on the findings, EFL learners of Master of Arts (M.A.) levels showed higher associations with CT. Since this meta-analysis can be considered one of the pioneers in internationalizing CT in EFL education, this study might be a cornerstone for subsequent steps in the teaching and research of CT in Iranian EFL educational fields. However, the high heterogeneity and potential publication bias underscore the need for cautious interpretation and further research.}

Their perception of CCUS can be rooted in technological and economic aspects but also in social and sustainability dynamics at play. This study aims to integrate stakeholders' knowledge to uncover and explore their perceptions about CCUS as a system and its potential outcomes. The investigation is based on systems thinking, network science using fuzzy cognitive mapping, and discursive landscape. The process involved participatory data collection, analysis, and elucidation.

It should also be emphasized that the phase of the wave function of a particle is inextricably linked with the quantum action S in the Feynman’s formulation of quantum mechanics (path integrals). A hypothesis is proposed: the set of particles that make up neurons and the brain is controlled by changing the phases from the outside (by a higher order system). Such a control system must be outside our world because our measurement methods do not allow us to determine the phase of an elementary particle. In a sense, it can be viewed as an extension of Bohm's ideas about the holographic brain and the holographic universe. Experiments are proposed that could confirm or disprove this model.}

Multiple linear regression revealed that fraction relational reasoning, fraction and decimal magnitude knowledge, fraction arithmetic, attentive behavior, counting recall, and listening recall were significant predictors in the final model. Relative weight analysis indicated the contribution of fraction relational reasoning to algebraic performance did not differ significantly from fraction magnitude knowledge and fraction arithmetic, but was a stronger predictor than the other variables. This suggests the central executive component of working memory, attention, fraction relational reasoning, magnitude knowledge of fractions and decimals, and fraction arithmetic may warrant focused attention when preparing children for algebra.}

Despite its widespread impact, stigma associated with HBV significantly hinders access to testing, diagnosis, and treatment. This study investigates the relationship between HBV stigma and cognitive distortions among individuals living with HBV by analyzing 35,697 posts from Yiyou Forum, China's largest HBV online community. Utilizing a large language model (LLM) for stigma classification, posts were categorized into stigma-related (S-posts) and non-stigma-related (N-posts). A schema comprising 235 n-grams was employed to identify 12 types of cognitive distortions within these posts. Statistical analyses revealed that S-posts had a prevalence ratio (PR) of 1.824 (95%CI [1.636, 2.074]) for cognitive distortions compared to N-posts, indicating that distorted thinking patterns were approximately 1.8 times more common in stigma-related discussions. Specific distortions such as disqualifying the positive, labeling and mislabeling, mental filtering, and should statements were significantly more prevalent in S-posts. User-level analysis confirmed that individuals engaging in stigma-related posts consistently displayed higher levels of cognitive distortions. These insights underscore the potential of targeted cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) interventions to address and mitigate cognitive distortions, thereby alleviating the psychological burden of HBV stigma. Additionally, this study demonstrates the efficacy of advanced computational methods in psychological research.}

Results suggested that the career personality styles (i.e. social, enterprising) that fit the vocational environment of kindergarten teaching the most positively predicted the students' career adaptability, both directly and indirectly through creativity-generating thinking styles. Moreover, the artistic and investigative career personality styles indirectly predicted students' career adaptability through creativity-generating thinking styles, while the conventional and realistic career personality styles showed no significant effect on the students' career adaptability.

The results showed that high-level mathematical thinking in processing geometrical problems would not produce instant behavioural impacts on learners’ L2 learning, although it inhibited learners’ brain function activation and network functional connectivity (FC) for language processing.

Teleological thought — the tendency to ascribe purpose to objects and events — is useful in some cases (encouraging explanation-seeking), but harmful in others (fueling delusions and conspiracy theories). What drives excessive and maladaptive teleological thinking? In causal learning, there is a fundamental distinction between associative learning versus learning via propositional mechanisms. Here, we propose that directly contrasting the contributions of these two pathways can elucidate the roots of excess teleology. We modified a causal learning task such that we could encourage associative versus propositional mechanisms in different instances. Across three experiments (total N = 600), teleological tendencies were correlated with delusion-like ideas and uniquely explained by aberrant associative learning, but not by learning via propositional rules. Computational modeling suggested that the relationship between associative learning and teleological thinking can be explained by excessive prediction errors that imbue random events with more significance — providing a new understanding for how humans make meaning of lived events.}

The two fold model theory of creativity believes that the generation of creative thinking includes two processes: concept generation and concept evaluation. Among them, individuals will rely more on non-automatic top-down control processing for cognitive information processing in the process of concept evaluation. Critical thinking belongs to analytical thinking, which focuses on and doubts the information bias in the generation of ideas to restrain. Therefore, this study assumes that the impact of critical thinking on creative thinking will occur in the process of concept evaluation, which is rational judgment rather than intuitive thinking. This study uses event-related potential (ERP) techniques to explore the explicit and implicit mechanisms of cognitive processing of creative information (i.e. role of intuition and rationality) in people with different critical thinking dispositions. The current study includes two experiments. Experiment 1 is an explicit ERP experiment, which uses a priming paradigm to examine the neural mechanisms underlying the explicit processing of creative information by individuals with different critical thinking dispositions. Experiment 2 is an implicit ERP experiment, which uses an alternative Stroop paradigm to examine the neural mechanisms underlying the implicit processing of creative information. Results found that the brain mechanisms of explicit cognition of creative information differed significantly across critical thinking dispositions. For low-critical thinking dispositions, low-creative characters evoked larger N1 waves than high-creative characters initiation conditions. For high-critical thinking dispositions, high-creative words evoked larger P2 waves than low-creative words. However, implicit cognition did not differ significantly. This result suggests that the cognitive processing of creative information by different critical thinkers is a rational thought process. The N1 and P2 components, which are indicators of cognitive sensitivity to creative information, can be used as markers to distinguish among different critical thinking dispositions.}

Consequently, the direct study of work processes necessitates our attention. However, organizational scholars tend not to study work processes directly. Instead, organizational scholars commonly develop theories about relationships among psychological construct phenomena that indirectly reference people’s affective, behavioral, cognitive, and/or social processes as underlying explanations. Specifically, construct-oriented theories summarize processes in operation across actors, time, and contexts, and thus, provide limited insights into how focal phenomena manifest directly as a function of process operations. Construct theories remain one-step removed from articulating sequences of actions and two-steps removed from describing generative mechanisms responsible for observed actions. By “missing the action,” construct theories offer incomplete explanatory accounts and imprecise interventions. We assert that researchers in organizational science can make progress towards addressing these concerns by directing greater attention to developing computational process theories. We begin by presenting a framework for differentiating theories based on their focus (constructs versus processes) and modality (narrative versus computational). We use the framework to contrast narrative construct theories to computational process theories. We then describe key design principles for developing computational process theories and explain those principles using a leadership example. We use simulated data, from the computational process model we develop, to explicitly demonstrate the differences between construct and process thinking. We then discuss how computational process theories advance theory development. We conclude with a discussion of the long-term benefits of computational process theories for organizational science.}

abstract = {Objective:
The incidence of myocardial infarction (MI) is increasing year by year and is characterized by a high mortality rate with rapid outbreaks. Electrocardiogram (ECG)-based detection and localization of myocardial infarction is susceptible to individual patient differences. We propose a new deep learning model to improve the detection and localization performance on different patient data.
Methods:
To address these issues, we propose SRTNet, a novel model with scanning, reading, and thinking modules, for MI detection and localization. The model learns ECG features from three different perspectives, namely, the scanning module for learning 12-lead ECG features, the reading module for learning the correlation features of different leads, and the thinking module for learning temporal dimension features. The model learned features contain both temporal and spatial ones that can alleviate overfitting individual differences.
Results:
In the experiments, we used 5-fold cross-validation in the PTB dataset to demonstrate the performance of SRTNet. The results show that SRTNet achieves the state-of-the-art performance. For detection performance, the accuracy is 99.25%, the sensitivity is 99.15%, the specificity is 98.58%, and the F1 score is 99.09%. For localization performance, the accuracy is 68.45%, the sensitivity is 61.82%, the specificity is 67.95% , and the F1 score is 60.50%.
Conclusion:
The experimental results show that SRTNet’s multi-level feature learning method can detect and locate MI more accurately.
Significance:
Furthermore, the design of SRTNet provided a new perspective on clinical MI detection and localization systems.}

Assessing HOTS can increase students’ awareness of their cognitive abilities and promote the development of advanced cognitive skills. This study proposes an automated assessment approach for HOTS, to overcome the limitations of existing methods that rely on experts and are often short-term. The exceptional knowledge base and advanced reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have prompted academics to extend their application to various areas, where they outperform models limited to specific domains. Inspired by this, we propose a framework for the automated assessment of HOTS using LLMs, called LLM4HA. The framework consists of two distinct models: a text-based exercise classification model constructed from pre-trained BERT, and a student HOTS assessment model based on response data, constructed by fine-tuning pre-trained LLMs. To validate the performance of our framework, we established a classification rule based on Bloom’s taxonomy for exercise classification. We collected 43,070 exercise data points from 181 undergraduate students, from which exercise text data and response data were obtained. The results demonstrate that LLM4HA successfully classifies exercises and assesses students’ HOTS. The BERT-based classification model outperforms ChatGPT-4, and the LLMs-based fine-tuning model significantly outperforms the RNNs-based model. A comprehensive analysis was conducted to identify the causes of this outcome. The findings indicate that the robust knowledge base and sophisticated architecture may be crucial for achieving optimal performance in the HOTS assessment task.

Supporting a comprehensive understanding of the cross-sectoral interdependencies and influences among sectors is a cutting-edge research issue, specifically as far as the production of ‘actionable’ knowledge for policy makers is concerned. Despite its success, the actual implementation of the Nexus holistic approach is still hampered by several barriers. Starting from the analysis of those barriers, this work describes a methodological approach based on Qualitative System Dynamic Model (and specifically Causal Loop Diagram – CLD), capable of enabling the transition from Nexus thinking to Nexus doing. The methodological approach maps and describes the dynamic evolution of complex WEFE Nexus systems, and proposes an innovative ‘leverage analysis’ – based on graph theory measures – for identifying policy interventions capable of impacting system state and potential evolution. The proposed approach is highly participatory as stakeholders engagement is facilitated throughout the modelling process. Besides a description of the methodology, the present work provides also full details on the results of its implementation in two different case studies in Europe.}

abstract = {Background
The COVID-19 pandemic outbreak has led to a sudden change in education, closing schools and shifting to online teaching, which has become an enormous challenge for teachers and students. Implementing adequate online pedagogical approaches and integrating different digital tools in the teaching process have become a priority in educational systems. Finding a way to keep students' interest and persistence in learning is an important issue that online education is facing. One possible way to establish engaging and interactive learning environments, using the energy and enthusiasm of students for educational purposes, is the use of game-based learning activities and gamification of different parts of the educational process.
Objective
This paper presents a use case of migrating an escape room–style educational game to an online environment by using the design thinking methodology. We wanted to show that the design thinking methodology is useful to create engaging and motivating online games that provide educational value.
Methods
Starting from students’ perspective, we created a simple digital escape room–style game where students got an opportunity to self-assess their knowledge in computer science at their own pace. Students tested this prototype game, and their opinions about the game were collected through an online survey. The test's goal was to evaluate the students' perceptions about the implemented digital escape room–style educational game and gather information about whether it could achieve students' engagement in learning computer science during online teaching.
Results
In total, 117 students from sixth and seventh grades completed the survey regarding the achieved student engagement. Despite the differences in students’ answers about game complexity and puzzle difficulty, most students liked the activity (mean 4.75, SD 0.67, on a scale from 1 to 5). They enjoyed the game, and they would like to participate in this kind of activity again (mean 4.74, SD 0.68). All (n=117, 100%) students found the digital escape room–style educational game interesting for playing and learning.
Conclusions
The results confirmed that digital escape room–style games could be used as an educational tool to engage students in the learning process and achieve learning outcomes. Furthermore, the design thinking methodology proved to be a useful tool in the process of adding novel educational value to the digital escape room–style game.}

abstract = {Three-way decision is about thinking, problem-solving, and computing in threes or through triads. Its philosophy and practice of triadic thinking appear everywhere. In particular, there are a number of three-world or triworld models in different fields and disciplines, where a complex system, a complicated issue, or an intricate concept is explained and understood in terms of three interrelated worlds, with each world enclosing a group of elements or representing a particular view. This paper examines various triadic metaphors and structures in general and three-world metaphors and conceptions in particular for building and explaining basic concepts of three-way decision. The three major objectives are (a) to formulate a TAO (Triading-Acting-Optimizing) framework of three-way decision, (b) to discuss the Dao, the Way of three-way decision, and (c) to articulate the Dao, the Way of three-world thinking. Three-world conceptions offer more insights into three-way decision with new viewpoints, methods, and modes. An emphasis of the paper is on the philosophy and the power of three-way decision for building high-level conceptual models. By using three-part structures, by focusing on only three things, or by considering three basic ingredients, we may build a theory, a model, or a method that is simple-to-understand, easy-to-remember, and practical-to-use.}

By integrating technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, virtual reality (VR), and augmented reality (AR), the metaverse presents considerable potential for creating customized teaching environments and promoting situated learning. However, current research on the Metaverse Teaching Scene (MTS) primarily involves qualitative discussions, lacking empirical evidence on how MTS influences students' creative thinking and collaborative intentions. This study, grounded in Situated Learning Theory and the Stimuli-Organism-Response (S-O-R) paradigm, explores the factors that affect students' creative thinking and collaborative intentions within MTS. Data were gathered from 316 Chinese university students through questionnaires and analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM) and artificial neural networks (ANN). The results indicate that contextual cognition factors (e.g., immersion, learning motivation, interactive experience, perceived incentives) in MTS enhance students' self-efficacy and emotional responses, which in turn foster creative thinking and collaborative intentions. Moreover, the study reveals that self-efficacy positively mediates the association between emotions and creative thinking. These findings highlight the crucial role of MTS in advancing situated learning and suggest that educators incorporate MTS to design customized learning environments and activities that boost student engagement and improve learning outcomes.}

The LSNN model alleviates the sparsity of data. Through comparative experiments on related data, the data sparsity is 0.7–0.9. The LSNN prediction is higher than that of Euclidean Distance and Pearson correlation coefficient, which proves that LSNN can alleviate data sparsity. The LSNN model has the lowest mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.83, which is smaller than the previous CNN's MAE.

abstract = {In the rapidly evolving landscape of digital competencies, the need for a robust and universal method to assess students’ algorithmic thinking (AT) skills has become increasingly pronounced. Algorithmic thinking refers to the ability to analyse a problem and develop a step-by-step process to solve it. This research investigates the efficacy of the Cross Array Task (CAT) as an assessment tool for AT skills within Switzerland’s compulsory education system. Originally conceptualised as an unplugged activity, where students performed the task without digital technologies (e.g., by using gestures on paper) and an administrator manually assessed them, the CAT evolved into a digital activity that runs on an iPad. The CAT’s digital transformation has automated the scoring of student responses and data collection, streamlining the assessment processes and facilitating efficient large-scale assessments. It has also enhanced scalability, making the CAT suitable for widespread use in educational settings. Furthermore, it provides immediate feedback to students and educators, supporting timely interventions and personalised learning experiences. Our study aims to comprehensively investigate algorithmic competencies in compulsory education, examining their variations and influencing factors. This research examines key variables, such as age, sex, educational environment and school characteristics (e.g., the level and grade of education), and regional factors (e.g., the canton of the school) in Switzerland, and characteristics related to the specific assessment tool, including the type of artefact used, the complexity of the algorithms generated, and the level of autonomy. Additionally, it seeks to analyse the effectiveness of the unplugged and digital approaches in assessing AT skills, specifically comparing the unplugged and virtual CAT versions, aiming to provide insights into their advantages and potential synergies. This investigation delineates the developmental progression of AT skills across compulsory education, emphasising the influence of age on algorithm development and problem-solving strategies. Furthermore, we reveal the impact of artefacts and the potential of digital tools to facilitate advanced AT skill development across diverse age groups. Finally, our investigation delves into the influence of school environments and sex disparities on AT performance, alongside the significant individual variability influenced by personal abilities and external circumstances. These findings underscore the importance of tailored educational interventions and equitable practices to accommodate diverse learning profiles and optimise student outcomes in AT across educational settings.}

These applications are associated with a number of challenges, mainly related to the dynamic and prospective nature of policy IA, typically forward-looking into 10–20 years ahead. This requires the application of prospective scenario analyses to develop the baseline scenario, reflecting the ‘do nothing’ into the future (business-as-usual), and the alternative scenarios, reflecting the consequences incurred by the implementation of the policy options under study. Such prospective and broadened boundary nature of policy IA challenges traditional LCA/LCC practices mostly based on retrospective, static scenarios and datasets. The present study provides an overview of recent IA studies supporting waste policy to show the state-of-the-art and the main challenges associated with the application of life cycle methods in IA, focusing on the most recent EU waste and circular economy policies. Moreover, since specific and transparent guidance on how to implement consistently these methods in policy IA is lacking, the study provides an initial guidance for application of life cycle thinking in IA drawing upon the knowledge obtained conducting waste policy IA studies. Key challenges in the field are still to be addressed, and might inspire further research to improve the application of life cycle thinking to policy assessment.}

Anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) has shown to have effects on different domains of cognition yet there is a gap in the literature regarding effects on reflective thinking performance.
Objective
The current study investigated if single session and repeated anodal tDCS over the right DLPFC induces effects on judgment and decision-making performance and whether these are linked to working memory (updating) performance or cognitive inhibition.
Methods
Participants received anodal tDCS over the right DLPFC once (plus sham tDCS in a second session) or twice (24 h apart). In the third group participants received a single session of sham stimulation only. Cognitive characteristic measures were administered pre-stimulation (thinking disposition, impulsivity, cognitive ability). Experimental tasks included two versions of the Cognitive Reflection Test (numeric vs verbal-CRT), a set of incongruent base-rate vignettes, and two working memory tests (Sternberg task and n-back task). Forty-eight participants (mean age = 26.08 ± 0.54 years; 27 females) were recruited.
Results
Single sessions of tDCS were associated with an increase in reflective thinking performance compared to the sham conditions, with stimulation improving scores on incongruent base rate tasks as well as marginally improving numeric CRT scores (compared to sham), but not thinking tasks without a numeric component (verbal-CRT). Repeated anodal stimulation only improved numeric CRT scores. tDCS did not increase working memory (updating) performance. These findings could not be explained by a practice effect or a priori differences in cognitive characteristics or impulsivity across the experimental groups.
Conclusion
The current results demonstrate the involvement of the right DLPFC in reflective thinking performance which cannot be explained by working memory (updating) performance or general cognitive characteristics of participants.}

For that purpose, we use the seminar transcripts of the Design Thinking Research Symposium 12 (DTRS12) dataset “Tech-centred Design Thinking: Perspectives from a Rising Asia,” which are primarily concerned with how Korean companies implement design thinking and what role designers currently play. We employed a novel method of information processing based on constructed dynamic semantic networks to investigate the seminar discussions according to company representatives and company size. We compared the quantitative dynamics in two seminars: the first involved managerial representatives of four companies, and the second involved specialized designers and management of a design center of single company. On the basis of dynamic semantic networks, we quantified the changes in four semantic measures—abstraction, polysemy, information content, and pairwise word similarity—in chronologically reconstructed individual design-thinking processes. Statistical analyses show that design thinking in the seminar with four companies, exhibits significant differences in the dynamics of abstraction, polysemy, and information content, compared to the seminar with the design center of single company. Both the decrease in polysemy and abstraction and the increase in information content in the individual design-thinking processes in the seminar with four companies indicate that design managers are focused on more concrete design issues, with more information and less ambiguous content to the final design product. By contrast, specialized designers manifest more abstract thinking and appear to exhibit a slightly higher level of divergence in their design processes. The results suggest that design thinking and creativity issues are articulated differently depending on designer roles and the company size.}

The qualitative data of the study were collected by using a semi-structured interview form prepared by the researcher. At the end of the study, it is believed that online DT instruction may have an impact on pre-service teachers' both DT and RT tendencies, and that pre-service teachers with low reflection and critical reflection tendencies may have benefited more from online DT instruction compared to those with higher tendencies.}

abstract = {This article explores the link between divergent thinking skills and the capacity of micro-entrepreneurs to implement social innovations. Drawing on Guilford's Structure of Intellect theory and the Oslo Manual's 4th version, the study employs quantitative research on 1848 Polish micro-entrepreneurs. Through exploratory factor analysis and probit model estimation, findings indicate that three aspects of divergent thinking—Fluency, Flexibility, and Development—positively influence social innovativeness. Fluency and Flexibility align with Guilford's theory, while Development - which is our proposal - reflects micro-entrepreneurs engagement in the thinking process. This study underscores the need for further research to solidify the observed relationship.}

The cognitive model enables the idea of information processes, from their birth and appearance in a scope, evolution and canceling out their existence and disappearing from the scope. Process habitats are Lawvere’s variable domains; inter-transition is based on the notion of channeled spreading of processes.}

abstract = {Detecting signs of rumination (specifically negative repetitive thinking) in social media data could be beneficial to predicting mental health, as rumination is associated with mental health problems. The objective of this study is to evaluate message similarity as a proxy measure of repetitive thinking (a core component of rumination), using data from Vent — a social media platform dedicated to emotion sharing. Our analyses suggest that automatic assessment of message similarity aligns with human judgements. Furthermore, message similarity is positively associated with signs of suicidal ideation/non-suicidal self-injury, and this association is stronger in users who post predominantly negative content, in line with observations from the literature. This effect has a relatively small magnitude and may be less visible in machine learning models with a large number of predictors. Our data suggests that message similarity may be a useful way of capturing repetitive content, which can potentially be used as a stepping stone to automatic rumination detection in social media data.}
