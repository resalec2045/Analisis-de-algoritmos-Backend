abstract = {Building basic computational thinking skills is an important goal in courses that introduce computing to students with limited programming background. Among choices of tools and platforms, MIT App Inventor is a popular mobile app development environment particularly suitable for engaging novice learners. Users are able to create their own mobile apps with real-world usefulness without having to deal with difficult language syntax. However, a study of computational thinking assessment showed students had difficulties in learning abstract concepts such as procedure and flow control using App Inventor [1]. Meanwhile, non-CS major students demonstrated a lack of continuous growth in computational thinking skills compared to CS major students [1]. In another recent study [2], students reported increased interests in computing after being exposed to modern responsive web development, but it is unclear if having an HTML/CSS background makes it more effective in learning abstract computational concepts when using App Inventor.},

abstract = {This paper presents a study using a robotics platform for teaching computing and cybersecurity concepts to high school students. 38 students attended a week-long camp, starting with projects such as a simulation-only game and a simple autonomous driving program for the robots in order to learn and apply computational thinking (CT) and networking skills. They were then assigned a series of challenges that required developing progressively more advanced cybersecurity measures to protect their robots. This culminated in a final challenge that required implementing defensive measures such as encryption, secure key exchange and sequence numbers. We used an evidence-centered design framework to construct rubrics for grading student work. The pre- and post-test results show that the interventions helped students learn cybersecurity and CT concepts, but they had difficulties with networking concepts. These results correlate with scores from the game and the final challenge. Overall, surveys show that the competition-based robotics learning framework engaged students and supported their overall learning, but our intervention needs to be modified to help students learn networking concepts},

abstract = {Geocomputation is an inherently interdisciplinary topic, combining both geospatial information science (GISc) and computer science (CS). It could be taught by individuals with strong backgrounds in both areas, but it is argued that such individuals are rare and academia is poorly positioned to produce a future generation of such dual-skilled individuals. Interdisciplinary team teaching is presented as an alternative. Hurdles to developing such team-taught classes are identified, and possible ways to overcome them are presented. Finally, a way of restructuring academia to be more supportive of such interdisciplinary team projects is presented.},

abstract = {This paper presents a study with kindergarten teachers to assess the advantages, challenges and opportunities of commercial robots to teach computational thinking to young children. Recent studies have highlighted the potential benefits of introducing CT concepts at an early stage. Robots are an engaging and effective educational tool for teaching CT to young children, providing hands-on and interactive learning experiences. Entirely tangible robotic environments have successfully connected the abstract world of CT with the concrete world of preschoolers. Children can program robots by pressing buttons, drawing the path or using code cards. However, there is limited research on the use of commercial robots in preschool classrooms. This research aims to address this gap by investigating preschool teachers’ perspectives on the advantages, challenges, and opportunities associated with using commercial robots in the context of kindergarten classrooms. We contribute with a list of practical, pedagogical and motivational aspects that should be taken into account while evaluating robots and design considerations to build robotic environments for kindergarten classrooms.},

abstract = {As many school districts nationwide continue to incorporate Computer Science (CS) and Computational Thinking (CT) instruction at the K-8 level, it is crucial that we understand the factors and skills, such as reading and math proficiency, that contribute to the success of younger learners in a computing curriculum and are typically developed at this age. Yet, little is known about the relationship between reading and math proficiency, and the learning of key CS concepts at the elementary level. This study focused on 4th-grade students (ages 9-10) who were taught events, sequence, and repetition through an adaptation of the Creative Computing Curriculum. While all students benefited from access to such a curriculum, there were statistically-significant differences in learning outcomes, especially between students whose reading and math proficiency are below grade-level, and students whose proficiency are at or above grade-level. This performance gap suggests the need for curricular improvement and learning strategies that are CS specific for students who struggle with reading and math.},

abstract = {Given the importance of the introductory programming course (CS1), the Computer Science Education community has devoted a significant effort to generate empirical evidence and propose tools, techniques, and curricular approaches to support students. For instance, Parsons Problems have emerged as one of the preferred scaffolding strategies to help CS1 students get a grasp on programming before being exposed to open write-code assignments. However, prior literature has not given enough attention to those students who fail CS1 and must retake the course. In this paper, we report the results of an exploratory case study aimed at understanding the effectiveness of Parsons Problems as an active scaffolding strategy delivered to CS1 retakers at the University of Chile. In this version of the course, although students were already introduced to computational thinking, program design, and coding (as they were taking CS1 for a second time), it was the first time they were exposed to Parsons Problems. We conducted a follow-up assessment of the students' perceptions throughout the course, employing a combination of focus groups, semi-structured interviews, and end-course surveys. Our results suggest that Parsons Problems are effective for learners beyond the ''novice programmer'' stage (such as the experience of CS1 retakers), highlighting good practices to support the studied group in terms of engagement, performance, and overall student experience.},

abstract = {Scratch users often struggle to detect and correct 'code smells' (bad programming practices) such as duplicated blocks and large scripts, which can make programs difficult to understand and debug. These 'smells' can be caused by a lack of abstraction, a skill that plays a key role in computer science and computational thinking. We created Pirate Plunder, a novel educational block-based programming game, that aims to teach children to reduce smells by reusing code in Scratch. This work describes an experimental study designed to measure the efficacy of Pirate Plunder with children aged 10 and 11. The findings were that children who played the game were then able to use custom blocks (procedures) to reuse code in Scratch, compared to non-programming and programming control groups.},

abstract = {To address the challenges of generative AI in CS1 education, especially its misuse by students to bypass coding exercises, which undermines their engagement with foundational learning, CS1 curricula are evolving to emphasize higher-level problem-solving and systems thinking. In response, a novel experiential learning initiative grounded in High-Impact Practices was introduced to a CS1 course over the course of 2 semesters, involving 132 students. This initiative utilized robotics lab assignments to enhance computational thinking across various levels of granularity, from individual functional components to overall system behaviors, bridging conceptual understanding with real-world applications. The approach emphasized project-based learning, extended engagement time, and reflective practices to deepen students' understanding of core computing concepts and scaffold knowledge integration. The curriculum featured both individual and team-based lab assignments to build foundational skills followed by collaborative problem-solving. The initiative's impact was assessed against a control group of 427 students who completed traditional web development lab assignments. Evaluation methods included thematic analyses of student reflections, instructor opinion surveys, and statistical analysis of exam performances across the semester. Results revealed a substantial positive effect on self-efficacy and learning outcomes. Students in the experiential learning group reported increased confidence in applying their computing skills to real-world scenarios, heightened engagement, and greater improvements in technical proficiency. Notably, their exam scores demonstrated a statistically significant improvement compared to the control group. These findings highlight the effectiveness of integrating practical, interactive elements into computer science education to meet the demands of a rapidly evolving technological landscape.},

abstract = {This poster reports on year one of a three-year NSF-funded Research Practitioner Partnership (RPP) to develop a K-8 pipeline for computer science (CS) and computational thinking (CT) education within two rural school districts in Eastern Kentucky : Pikeville Independent School District and Floyd County Schools. Economically devastated by the departure of the coal industry, these communities are committed to developing high-quality computing curricula for all students, beginning in their earliest years. The poster has two components. First, through a mixture of qualitative measures, the poster reports on the genesis and development of the RPP. It focuses on the RPP's origin in leveraging the districts' existing relationship with Pennsylvania's South Fayette School District, which has developed one of the nation's leading programs for teacher professional development (PD) in K-12 computing. The second component of the poster focuses on the development of a series of summer workshops for Kentucky Appalachia K-8 instructors to learn the basics of CS and CT and how to integrate these skills and concepts into existing K-8 coursework. Of course, the RPP faced new challenges with COVID-19 most notably, the need to offer these summer workshops remotely, and adjusting the objectives and research questions accordingly. Through focus groups with the PD instructional team and survey responses from the KY teacher workshop participants, the poster will report on the pedagogical implications of offering teacher PD exclusively online and what the ramifications have been for Pikeville and Floyd County children with the return to school in the Fall of 2020.},

abstract = {Games have been used for a few decades in research, formal education, and training of children and adults, and digital games are no strangers to educational uses. After all, everyone likes to play games, so it should stand to reason that educational digital games are going to be a hit. Unfortunately, this is not the case. In fact, educational digital games are often criticized for being too focused on educational content and not enough on engaging, challenging, and entertaining players. Making games for entertainment is difficult and requires multidisciplinary expertise. Making educational games that are engaging and entertaining is also difficult and requires additional input from educators and domain experts, and rigorous evaluation methodologies, all of which must revolve around the players. In this position article, we introduce the early stage “EduGames: Play to Learn” research project aimed at supporting the public in acquiring Critical and Computational Thinking skills to tackle the problem of detecting misinformation, and supporting the game development and research communities in creating and evaluating games that are entertaining and educational. As part of this project, we call for more, and more structured, synergy between academia, educators, and the game development industry.},

abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) are revolutionizing the field of computing education with their powerful code-generating capabilities. Traditional pedagogical practices have focused on code writing tasks, but there is now a shift in importance towards reading, comprehending and evaluating LLM-generated code. Alongside this shift, an important new skill is emerging -- the ability to solve programming tasks by constructing good prompts for code-generating models. In this work we introduce a new type of programming exercise to hone this nascent skill: 'Prompt Problems'. Prompt Problems are designed to help students learn how to write effective prompts for AI code generators. A student solves a Prompt Problem by crafting a natural language prompt which, when provided as input to an LLM, outputs code that successfully solves a specified programming task. We also present a new web-based tool called Promptly which hosts a repository of Prompt Problems and supports the automated evaluation of prompt-generated code. We deploy Promptly in one CS1 and one CS2 course and describe our experiences, which include student perceptions of this new type of activity and their interactions with the tool. We find that students are enthusiastic about Prompt Problems, and appreciate how the problems engage their computational thinking skills and expose them to new programming constructs. We discuss ideas for the future development of new variations of Prompt Problems, and the need to carefully study their integration into classroom practice.},

abstract = {Educators should provide access to all students with inclusive and equitable computer science (CS) and computational thinking (CT) learning outcomes. Yet access to CS and CT is not always available for students with disabilities. This qualitative cross-case study examined the barriers and strengths three exemplar teachers faced, explored the supports and resources they provided, and presented how these teachers defined successful inclusive CS learning outcomes for their students. The data set included analysis of the semistructured teachers' interviews and teaching materials. The results included seven successful strategies the teachers identified: 1) using physical computing, 2) pair programming, 3)connecting CS and Individual Education Plans (IEP), 4)applying hands-on activities, 5) CT integration, 6) using CS vocabulary, and 7)open-ended pedagogy. Three resources and supports the teacher provided emerged from the data set as follows: 1) accessible instructional materials, 2) projects with multiple entry points, and 3) essential scaffolding supports. Whereas four barriers teachers faced; 1. subject matter, 2) accessible tools, 3) students receiving support, 3) the role of CS in instruction, and 4) the role of time served as additional findings. The results suggested that school-based practitioners, including administrators, can overcome the barriers and promote successful strategies that lead to asset-based CS-inclusion in the classroom.},

This technology enables multiple users to interact with digital content overlaid on the physical world through their mobile devices. Collaborative MAR combined with tangible elements enhances learning by integrating physical objects that can be manipulated and interacted with in the augmented reality environment, providing a hands-on and immersive educational experience. This study explores the impact of tangible mobile augmented reality on collaboration and object manipulation. Our goal is to understand how mobile devices’ manipulation affects collocated students' collaboration in tangible MAR in terms of ease of use and collaboration. The study involves participants working in pairs to facilitate collaboration through a MAR game for developing the computational thinking skills of primary school students. Our goal is to compare the perceived behaviors and interactions that emerged in two distinct MAR settings: (1) Stand-mounted device condition, where the device is fixed on a mobile stand, and (2) Hand-held device condition, where the device is held by one of the team's players. The same task is simulated in both settings to allow for direct comparison. The results of this study can help inform the design and development of future MAR systems and provide insights into the potential benefits and challenges in terms of collaboration and object manipulation.},

abstract = {This experience report describes an approach for helping elementary schools integrate computational thinking and coding by leveraging existing resources and infrastructure that do not rely on 1-1 computing. A particular focus is using the school library and media center as a site to complement and enhance classroom instruction on coding. Further, our approach builds upon "unplugged" knowledge and practices that are already familiar to and motivating for students, in this case tabletop board games. Through these games, students can use their prior knowledge and ease with tabletop gaming mechanics to cue relevant ideas for core computational concepts. We describe a model and an instructional unit spanning across classroom and school library settings that builds upon board game play as a source domain for computing knowledge. Building on expansive framing, the model emphasizes instructional linkages being made between one domain (the tabletop board game) and another (specially designed Scratch project shells with partially complete code blocks) such that the reasoning activities and different contexts are seen as instantiations of the same encompassing context. We present the experiences of three elementary school teachers as they implemented the unit in their classrooms and with their school librarian. We also show initial findings on the impact of the unit on student interest (N=87), as measured by pre- and post- surveys. We conclude with lessons learned about ways to improve the unit and future classroom implementations.},

abstract = {Culturally responsive computing scholars often use the metaphor and heuristic of intersectionality to address issues of race and gender in research with Black, Brown, and Indigenous children in U.S. K12 computer science (CS) education. This has led to critical analyses that reveal the inequitable conditions that children of color face in CS education. Intersectionality has also supported curricular innovations and interventions that aim to make CS education more equitable by being responsive to children's identities and communities. However, the concept of class has received less attention than race and gender by culturally responsive computing scholars who draw on intersectionality in their CS education research. How might class fit into intersectional research and theory in culturally responsive computing scholarship? The objective of this paper is to answer this question with a proof-of-concept study that tests the feasibility of what we call worker-driven computing education. We introduce findings from our research and collaborations with current, once, and retired autoworkers in Detroit, Michigan to define the computational thinking idea of automation from their perspectives. Through analyzing qualitative data, a worker-driven definition of automation was developed by drawing on autoworker-expertise about the points of production in the auto-industry. Our findings reveal how this definition focuses on introducing automation in the context of lifelong learning about how to communicate and work across divisions of labor to make workplaces safe, healthy, and efficient.},

abstract = {This study covers a three-year, longitudinal K–12 outreach initiative that promoted computer science in Ireland from 2017–2020. During the first year, 2017–2018, 2900 students participated in a pilot phase. 7320 students participated in the implementation phase throughout the course of the academic years 2018–2019 and 2019–2020 in 2018. The program consisted of a free, two-hour camp that was delivered on-site at the school and exposed children to a variety of computing topics, including addressing misconceptions about computing, learning how to code, and investigating computational thinking. Schools self-selected, and the initiative reached several schools in every county in Ireland, as well as schools with a wide range of socioeconomic backgrounds and gender diversity. The primary school students’ ages ranged from third class (7–8 years old) to sixth year (17–18 years old) at second level. This paper focuses specifically on the research data collected during the implementation phase (N=1202) from the secondary school students (12 - 18 years old) not enrolled in the formal Leaving Certificate Computer Science subject. Looking at student perceptions of Computer Science and if the outreach positively impacted those perceptions and if it built student interest in pursuing further study in Computer Science.},
