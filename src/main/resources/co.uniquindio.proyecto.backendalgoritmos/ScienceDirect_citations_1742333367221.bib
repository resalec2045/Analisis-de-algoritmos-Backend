abstract = {Currently, flipped learning requires a framework that will give novices and students the ability to face the complex problems encountered in programming courses. It is necessary to design a design thinking learning framework that addresses independent learning and specific processes that will improve students' 21st-century skills. The existing literature has not implemented flipped programming courses from a design thinking perspective (Cook & Bush, 2018), which would thus be an innovative approach to designing teaching methods and investigating the effects of this framework. The purpose of this study was to develop analyze, observe, reflect, conceive, design, implement, and operate (Crawley et al., 2007) a DT-CDIO model and to investigate the relationship of the flow experience to computational thinking and cognitive load in order to understand the impact of the flow experience on a flipped programming course. The participants in this study comprised 40 pre-service education students (Male = 17; Female = 23). The partial least squares (PLS) method was used for the data analysis to test the model. This study was intended to obtain and evaluate significant differences between the students' flow experience and their computational thinking ability and cognitive load. The results indicated that the DT-CDIO pedagogy filled a long-standing gap related to a lack of reflective pedagogy and design thinking problems. The flow experience negatively impacted creativity and problem solving ability. Meanwhile, intrinsic cognitive load negatively impacted the flow experience. Germane cognitive load positively impacted the flow experience. In particular, the flow experience is a crucial factor that can be used to predict various computational thinking skills in a programming curriculum. More importantly, this study provides important insights into the implications of the DT-CDIO approach and other related factors.}

Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy is characterised by the heterogeneous cellular kinetic profile seen across patients. Unlike traditional chemotherapy, which displays predictable dose-exposure relationships resulting from well-understood pharmacokinetic processes, CAR T-cell dynamics rely on complex biologic factors that condition treatment response. Computational approaches hold potential to explore the intricate cellular dynamics arising from CAR T therapy, yet their ability to improve cancer treatment remains elusive. Here we present a comprehensive framework through which to understand, construct, and classify CAR T-cell kinetics models. Current approaches often rely on adapted empirical pharmacokinetic methods that overlook dynamics emerging from cellular interactions, or intricate theoretical multi-population models with limited clinical applicability. Our review shows that the utility of a model does not depend on the complexity of its design but on the strategic selection of its biological constituents, implementation of suitable mathematical tools, and the availability of biological measures from which to fit the model.}

The results showed that senior high school students gave higher scores for scientists’ cognitive character construct than junior high and elementary school students did. Students from eastern regions, which have a more highly developed economy, gave the highest scores on cognitive and affective character constructs of scientists. Students from western regions, which have a less developed economy, had a relatively negative impression of scientists. Students’ images of scientists’ affective, lifestyle, and job characters were positively correlated with their interests in pursuing scientific careers. Future research to explore the relationships between students’ mental images of scientists’ characters and students’ motivation to pursue science-related careers or to engage in scientific practices are recommended.}

The current study analyzes the effect of an individual, 2-session, RNT-focused, acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) protocol in the treatment of moderate emotional disorders. Ten adults suffering from moderate to severe emotional symptoms according to the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21) and the General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12) participated in the study. Participants completed 5- to 7-week baselines without showing improvement trends in the DASS-21 or the GHQ-12. Afterwards, they received the ACT protocol, and a 3-month follow-up was conducted. A Bayesian approach to analyze clinically significant changes (CSC) for single-case experimental designs (SCED) was conducted, which required at least substantial evidence of the intervention effect and scores in the nonclinical range. Nine of the 10 participants showed CSC in the GHQ-12, and 7 participants in the DASS-21. The standardized mean difference effect sizes for SCED were computed, which facilitates comparison and integration of the results with group designs. Very large effect sizes were found for emotional symptoms (d = 2.44 and 2.68), pathological worry (d = 3.14), experiential avoidance (d = 1.32), cognitive fusion (d = 2.01), repetitive thinking (d = 2.51), and valued living (d = 1.54 and 1.41). No adverse events were found. RNT-focused ACT protocols deserve further empirical tests.}

This article presents the development of computational thinking competencies in 12-year-old students who participated in a learning-by-design or a learning-by-teaching ML course. The results, based on a qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the students’ achievements, indicate that they demonstrated computational thinking competencies at various levels. The learning by design group evidenced greater development in computational skills, whereas the learning by teaching group improved in terms of computational perspective. These findings are discussed with respect to promoting children’s problem-solving competencies within a constructionist approach to ML.}

The process represents thinking as inner dialogue with the self in second person. The dynamic effect of the rewrite shows characters proper to internal measurement, disequilibration by equilibration and transfer of inconsistency to the neighborhood by local resolution of the inconsistency. As the result, the advent of contradiction is postponed by the rewrite. The duality of internal measurement subject prevents inner dialogue in second person from lapsing into monologue.

Yet, little is known about the underlying neurocomputational mechanisms of pragmatic inference, let alone relevant differences among individuals. Here, using a reference game combined with model-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we showed that an individual-level pragmatic inference model was a better predictor of listeners’ performance than a population-level model. Our fMRI results showed that Bayesian posterior probability was positively correlated with activity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and ventral striatum and negatively correlated with activity in dorsomedial PFC, anterior insula (AI), and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). Importantly, individual differences in higher-order reasoning were correlated with stronger activation in IFG and AI and positively modulated the vmPFC functional connectivity with AI. Our findings provide a preliminary neurocomputational account of how the brain represents Bayesian belief inferences and the neural basis of heterogeneity in such reasoning.}

In this context, the inputs to a computation are encoded as initial values of certain chemical species while the outputs are the limiting values of other chemical species. In this paper, we design chemical systems that carry out the elementary arithmetic computations of: identification, inversion, mth roots (for m≥2), addition, multiplication, absolute difference, rectified subtraction over non-negative real numbers, and partial real inversion over real numbers. We prove that these “elementary modules” have a speed of computation that is independent of the inputs to the computation. Moreover, we prove that finite sequences of such elementary modules, running in parallel, can carry out composite arithmetic over real numbers, also at a rate that is independent of inputs. Furthermore, we show that the speed of a composite computation is precisely the speed of the slowest elementary step. Specifically, the scale of the composite computation, i.e. the number of elementary steps involved in the composite, does not affect the overall asymptotic speed – a feature of the parallel computing nature of our algorithm. Our proofs require the careful mathematical analysis of certain non-autonomous systems, and we believe this analysis will be useful in different areas of applied mathematics, dynamical systems, and the theory of computation. We close with a discussion on future research directions, including numerous important open theoretical questions pertaining to the field of computation with reaction networks.}

We involved 9 teachers and 26 students (14–15 y) in Denmark in teaching about machine learning and augmented reality. In the article we develop a framework for applying computational empowerment in formal educational contexts. Based on the study, we found that computational empowerment builds on distinct layers which are these four principles. Specifically, merging the principles Closeness and Embodied Learning can increase student engagement and motivation in the activities; in addition, Decoding and Design Process are key principles for promoting student awareness of the societal impacts of emerging technologies.

Each sample contains the car’s outer contour shape’s functional, structural, and Kansei features. Secondly, we proposed an improved conditional Wasserstein generative adversarial network (CWGAN) model suitable to the dataset. The generator’s loss in the model is designed to evaluate the authenticity of the generated results, while the discriminator’s loss assesses the conditional matching of these results. Finally, in case studies, the trained CWGAN was compared with the conditional variational auto-encoder (C-VAE), diffusion, Wasserstein generative adversarial network with gradient penalty (WGAN-GP) and style generative adversarial network (StyleGAN) models, demonstrating superior performance.}

In order to explore this question, the effects of IT in authentic research settings were studied through retrospective interviews with 24 academic researchers. Analysis of the researchers’ descriptions of their learning and thinking processes shows that the effects of IT on higher order thinking strategies can be classified, following Perkins [Perkins, D. N. (1985). The fingertip effect: How information processing technology changes thinking. Educational Researcher, 14(7), 11–17], into first order effects and second order effects. First order effects of IT amplify or improve existing thinking strategies, without changing their nature, while second order effects of IT cause significant changes in the researchers’ thinking strategies. The results demonstrate that both types of effects take place in authentic research settings, often existing side by side. This article explores several examples of the ways in which IT affects higher order thinking strategies (such as forming research questions, constructing models and evaluating information), examines the types of effects created by IT, the conditions required for these effects to take place, and the role of distributed cognition.}

To date, this literature has focused on identifying the psychological states (e.g., moral beliefs, memories) that people rely on when making identity judgments. But the notion of personal identity depends on more than just psychological states. Most people also believe that the physical matter that makes up an individual is an important criterion for judging identity; changes to the physical stuff in a person’s body, even if they are not accompanied by any psychological changes, are judged to change who the person is at some level. Here, we investigate the sources of these beliefs and propose that they stem from the broader cognitive tendency to assume that unseen physical essences make things what they are—psychological essentialism. Four studies provided support for this claim. In Studies 1 and 2, exposing participants to essentialist reasoning led to stronger endorsement of physical continuity as a criterion for personal identity. Similarly, individual differences in participants’ essentialist thinking predicted the extent of their reliance on physical continuity (Study 3), and this relationship was observed even among 6- to 9-year-old children (Study 4). These studies advance theory on the psychology of personal identity by identifying a reason why people assign a central role to physical composition when judging identity.}

abstract = {The evolving nature of system-of-systems requirements and corresponding architecture, and the complex causal relationship between the architecture of system-of-systems and its emergent behavior make the problem of system-of-systems architecture development a great challenge. As a tentative effort in meeting this special challenge, a new evolutionary computation paradigm–named Cognition Evolutionary Computation(CEC) is proposed, which models the creative cognition process of divergent and convergent thinking, adaptation and innovation, that drives the co-evolution of problem space, knowledge space and solution space. The optimization algorithm for CEC uses causal probabilistic network as the knowledge representation mechanism. A theoretical framework for CEC based system-of-system architecture generation, evaluation and optimization is discussed.}

We examine how (i) cognitive load, (ii) the affective-richness of the product, and (iii) the consumer's propensity for intuitive decision-making influence relative thinking. As hypothesized, high cognitive load and affect-rich (vs. affect-poor) products, and individual level preference for intuitive decision-making aggravate this behavior. Our results present clear managerial implications along with developing a better understanding of the behavioral foundations of relative thinking.}

The present study investigated the potential for machine learning to classify more and less creative brain states. Participants completed an Alternate Uses Task, in which they thought of Normal or Uncommon (more creative) uses for everyday objects (e.g., brick). We hypothesized that alpha power would be greater for Uncommon (vs. Common) uses, and that a machine learning (ML) approach would enable the reliable classification data from the two conditions. Further, we expected that ML would be successful at classifying more (vs. less) creative individuals. As expected, alpha power was significantly greater for the Uncommon than for the Normal condition. Using spectrally weighted common spatial patterns to extract EEG features, and quadratic discriminant analysis, we found that classification accuracy for the two conditions varied widely among individuals, with a mean of 63.9%. For more vs. less creative individuals, 82.3% classification accuracy was attained. These findings indicate the potential for broader adoption of machine learning in creativity research.}

Due to inadequate detection, heterogeneity in tumor formation, chemoresistance, drug resistance, and also manifestation of metastases, the death rate is increasing. Hence, managing of these challenges needs more potent and effective anticancer drugs. The new drug development requires longer time and more cost. Therefore, in the recent technological advancement, search for alternate methods to develop new drugs is a necessary step, which can remove the complex processes, lessen cost, shorten time, and improves success rates. Drug repurposing, computational chemistry, and Artificial Intelligence-assisted approaches are new and novel way of thinking toward the development of anticancer drugs. Drug repurposing with AI can develop a novel effective and specific anticancer drug for the treatment of cancer. The application of AI helps to diagnose the actual cause of cancerous development in the patient and also to determine the doses of effective drugs to be applied for particular cancer. AI together with computational chemistry provides an enhancement to the medical system for the effective diagnosis and treatment of cancer.}

abstract = {‘Sustainable intensification’ is gaining popularity among academics and donor agencies without much examination of the ambiguities in both terms, made worse by combining them. The terms can be made more serviceable by distinguishing between definitions by extension and definitions by intension. Difficulties with the term ‘intensification’ are addressed by considering the System of Rice Intensification (SRI). This reverses Green Revolution thinking about intensification as a matter of increasing material inputs. Changes in crop management can raise food output by reducing such inputs, with increased reliance on knowledge and management that use available resources more productively and sustainably. Its initial increases in labor inputs are usually transitory. Conjunctions of different disciplines and different levels of analysis and action are considered with reference to the factors of nestedness and contingence. Subjects bearing on sustainable intensification which can benefit from disciplinary convergence include: biogeochemistry to address problems of climate change; part-time farming to adapt to changing economic opportunities; and symbiotic endophytes that can enhance crop health and growth. The concept of ‘causation’ is disaggregated to consider ‘processual’ as distinguished from ‘mechanistic’ causation. Systems thinking is likely to be more productive for addressing interactions within and between subsystems rather than for theorizing about systems as a whole.}

Importantly, the same circuit can have multiple points of failure, each of which results in a different type of dysregulation, and thus elicits distinct cascades downstream that produce divergent signs and symptoms. Here, we illustrate this challenge by examining how subtle differences in circuit perturbations can lead to divergent clinical outcomes. We also discuss how computational models can perform the spatially heterogeneous integration and bridge in vitro and in vivo paradigms. By leveraging recent methodological advances and tools, computational models can integrate relevant processes across scales (e.g., tricarboxylic acid cycle, ion channel, neural microassembly, whole-brain macrocircuit) and across physiological systems (e.g., neural, endocrine, immune, vascular), providing a framework that can unite these mechanistic processes in a manner that goes beyond the conceptual and descriptive to the quantitative and generative. These hold the potential to sharpen our intuitions toward circuit-based models for personalized diagnostics and treatment.}

The graph structure is a typical tool used to formulate such correlations, it is incapable of modeling high-order correlations among different objects in systems; thus, the graph structure cannot fully convey the intricate correlations among objects. Confronted with the aforementioned two challenges, hypergraph computation models high-order correlations among data, knowledge, and rules through hyperedges and leverages these high-order correlations to enhance the data. Additionally, hypergraph computation achieves collaborative computation using data and high-order correlations, thereby offering greater modeling flexibility. In particular, we introduce three types of hypergraph computation methods: ① hypergraph structure modeling, ② hypergraph semantic computing, and ③ efficient hypergraph computing. We then specify how to adopt hypergraph computation in practice by focusing on specific tasks such as three-dimensional (3D) object recognition, revealing that hypergraph computation can reduce the data requirement by 80% while achieving comparable performance or improve the performance by 52% given the same data, compared with a traditional data-based method. A comprehensive overview of the applications of hypergraph computation in diverse domains, such as intelligent medicine and computer vision, is also provided. Finally, we introduce an open-source deep learning library, DeepHypergraph (DHG), which can serve as a tool for the practical usage of hypergraph computation.}

Yet, despite the many recent efforts in cross-cultural comparisons, two key questions remain underaddressed: are current methodologies in the psychology of thinking inherently biased toward explaining Western behavior? Or, to push even further, is the discipline of psychology itself such a product of Western culture that it limits its ability to uncover universal aspects of human thinking? This paper is a modest exploration of these two questions.}

With the much advancement in these areas, the realization of IoT is becoming increasingly probable. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive power control scheme for IoT systems. Based on the cognitive hierarchy thinking mechanism, our proposed scheme is designed as a new behavioral game model to adaptively control the power level. To effectively solve the power control problem in IoT systems, game theory is well-suited and an effective tool. The experimental result illustrates that our game-based approach can get an effective transmission power, which can make the communication rate maximal. Under dynamic IoT system environments, it is highly desirable property.}

This gap in AI literacy primary school education presents theoretical and pedagogical challenges. Despite the pervasive influence of AI, which can exacerbate inequalities and raise ethical challenges, primary students often lack an understanding of AI principles and mechanisms. Recent developments in age-appropriate AI learning tools have extended AI literacy to primary schools, but AI literacy frameworks for this age group remain underdeveloped. This study aims to conceptualize AI literacy by analyzing existing theoretical frameworks and proposing a new inclusive AI literacy framework for young students. A scoping review is employed using four credible index databases, and 19 articles are selected, with 17 AI literacy frameworks identified across all educational levels, from early childhood to university. This study reveals that the predominant methodologies for developing AI literacy frameworks involve empirical research studies and literature reviews, adhering to national government or institutional standards. These frameworks commonly incorporate 1) Bloom's taxonomy or a similar progression framework, such as Use-Create-Modify, 2) constructionism, and 3) computer science perspectives such as theories of computation. The findings reveal that AI literacy is situated at the intersection of digital literacy, data literacy, computational thinking, and AI ethics, emphasizing the need for a transdisciplinary and interdisciplinary approach that encompasses both technological and societal impacts. However, the study argues that the current paradigms of AI literacy frameworks for young students often emphasize constructionist perspectives without fully considering the interactions between human and technological agents. This gap highlights the necessity for a new conceptual framework that acknowledges both human and non-human agents in AI literacy education for young students. The research contributes by conceptualizing AI literacy and guiding policymakers and curriculum designers to implement holistic AI literacy education for young students.}

Multiple factors shape adaptive responses to a changing climate because of the complexities and multi-disciplinary nature of these three systems. In this study, the conceptual model CISTA-A (CISTA for Agro-ecosystems) is developed using Indicators that are identified as using a Systems Thinking approach to Adaptation. CISTA addresses questions concerning “how to adapt” our ecosystems to climate change and has three or more layers: A base (element) layer has abiotic/biotic information (e.g. ecological, agro-hydrological, and meteorological data). One or more components (intermediate) layer(s) have ecological, agro-hydrological, and climatological indicators (e.g. length of the growing season and growing degree days) that affect the ecosystem. Indicators are identified and estimated from an element layer. In the final layer, the translation of information from indicators to adaptation strategies (incremental systems and transformational adaptation) depends on the degree of change and the level of adaptation. CISTA can stand alone or combine with existing crop/integrated assessment models to develop quantitative adaptation strategies. The use of 23 indicators and 3 empirical tests in the agro-ecosystems (AS) of Kansas, USA demonstrate the application of CISTA-A.}

Previous evidence indicates that suppressing retrieval, which recruits executive control mechanisms to prevent unwanted memories entering consciousness, can cause forgetting, termed suppression-induced forgetting (SIF). Since these executive mechanisms involve multiple mental operations, we hypothesize that the efficacy of SIF may be limited by individuals’ capacity limitation of cognitive control. Here, we tested this hypothesis. Participants were assigned to two groups based on the median of their cognitive control capacity (CCC, estimated by the backward masking majority function task) and performed the think/no-think task with electrophysiological signals recorded. The results showed that the SIF effect was observed only in the high CCC group but not in the low CCC group. In accordance, repeated suppression attempts also resulted in a steeper reduction in intrusive thoughts in the high CCC group. Furthermore, ERP analysis revealed a decrease in recollection-related late parietal positivity (LPP) under the no-think condition in the high CCC group. A mediation analysis revealed that the reduced intrusive memories mediated the effect of CCC on SIF. These findings suggest that suppressing retrieval could reduce traces of the unwanted memories, making them less intrusive and harder to recall. More importantly, successful SIF is constrained by the capacity of cognitive control which may be used to ensure the coordination of multiple cognitive processes during suppression.}

Structural equation modeling revealed that both associations positively predicted DT originality and switch distance, but controlled association negatively impacted DT fluency. Regression analyses showed that associative abilities did not directly predict creative behaviors and controlled association negatively impacted creative self-efficacy. Instead, these traits were primarily predicted by the quantity of DT responses. Exploratory analyses revealed that the quantity of DT responses mediated the negative impact of T1 controlled association on T2 creative self-efficacy, self-identity, openness, and behavior. On the other hand, the quality of DT responses mediated the positive effect of controlled association on T2 creative behavior. These findings support the dual-process perspective of associative theory and highlight the greater influence of associative processes in the early stages of creative thinking.}

In parallel emerged the ability to detach oneself from the immediate environment to process abstract thoughts and solve problems and to understand other individuals’ thoughts and intentions. Rostrolateral prefrontal cortex (RLPFC) is thought to play an important role in supporting the integration of abstract, often self-generated, thoughts. Thoughts can be temporally abstract and relate to long term goals, or past or future events, or relationally abstract and focus on the relationships between representations rather than simple stimulus features. Behavioural studies have provided evidence of a prolonged development of the cognitive functions associated with RLPFC, in particular logical and relational reasoning, but also episodic memory retrieval and prospective memory. Functional and structural neuroimaging studies provide further support for a prolonged development of RLPFC during adolescence, with some evidence of increased specialisation of RLPFC activation for relational integration and aspects of episodic memory retrieval. Topics for future research will be discussed, such as the role of medial RPFC in processing abstract thoughts in the social domain, the possibility of training abstract thinking in the domain of reasoning, and links to education.}

abstract = {This paper discusses why conventional project management practices lead to the failure of publicly funded innovation deployment projects, and investigates how the use of systems thinking in project management can help projects be more successful. Based on 12 case studies of two EU innovation policies, we provide evidence that by using systemic project management, which entails providing flexibility in planning, communicating and controlling activities, innovation projects are more successful. This research refutes previous theory that claims that we should formalize to manage complexity and uncertainty. The key finding is that systems thinking methods provide the flexibility to manage innovativeness, complexity and uncertainty in innovation projects more successfully. Suggestions for further research include suggestions of how to embed flexibility in project management methods using the constructs of equifinality and causal embeddedness.}

abstract = {A central theme of this chapter and of this book is that individuals are smart and this sense rational and can be expected to make smart choices. But these choices typically do not conform the behavioural norms specified by conventional economics for rational behaviour and, therefore, for rational choices. Smart thinking encompasses behaviour that is based on what the individuals deem to be the best path towards achieving their objectives. This behaviour is heavily affected by their decision-making environment as well as their decision-making capabilities, neither of which need be ideal nor fit for purpose. Smart thinking and smart decision-making therefore overlap with the concepts of bounded rationality and satisficing developed by Simon. But smart thinking or broadly rational behaviour might very well appear to be irrational from the prism of conventional economics because they typically don’t conform to conventional behavioural norms for rationality. I also argue, flowing upon Gigerenzer’s fast and frugal heuristics narrative, that adhering to these conventional behavioural norms can result in sub-optimal outcomes from the point of view of the individual decision-maker. Indeed, adopting different behavioural norms and making different choices often yield better outcomes. Being neoclassically rational can actually yield sub-optimal or inefficient outcomes. Ultimately, optimal decision-making norms is context dependent—one size does not fit all. These norms can involve either slow or fast thinking (Kahneman), dependent on circumstance. Also, in the smart thinking narrative errors and biases in decision-making can still take place, but they are correctable through experience and appropriate changes in decision-making capabilities and the decision-making environment. The latter can also correct for any externalities that are often part and parcel of smart or rational decision-making. This chapter also provides a chapter-by-chapter summary of this book.}

Multilevel modeling showed that individuals with increasing levels of depression showed lower levels of concreteness in their daily thinking. Further analysis revealed a significant positive association between momentary ruminative self-focus and concurrent negative affect only with low concreteness of thinking. These results suggested that individuals with increasing levels of depression chronically process self-related information on an abstract level, which reflects a malfunction of their self-regulatory cycle and might serve to maintain or even exacerbate dysphoric moods.}

ABSTRACT
Biologists consider variability during biological investigations. A robust quantitative understanding of variability is particularly important during data analysis, where statistics are used to quantify variation and draw conclusions about phenomena while accounting for variation. Many students struggle to correctly apply a quantitative understanding of variation to statistically analyze data. We present quantitative and qualitative analyses of introductory biology students’ responses on two pairs of multiple-choice questions querying two concepts related to the quantitative analysis of variation. More students correctly identify a mathematical expression of variation than correctly interpret it. Many students correctly interpret a nonsignificant p-value in the context of a very small sample size, but fewer students do so in the context of a large sample size. These results imply that many students have an incomplete quantitative understanding of variation. These findings suggest that instruction focusing on conceptual understanding, not procedural problem solving, may elevate students’ quantitative understanding of variation.}

Twenty ASD children, 20 LD, and 20 typically developed (TD) children were tested on metaphors and idioms comprehension tests, homophone meaning generation test, and fluency tests. Both ASD and LD groups performed poorly compared with TD on all tests, with the LD group outperformed the ASD group in the executive function tests. The results indicate that the LD group was able to use the “thinking maps” to understand metaphors that were encountered for the first time more efficiently than the ASD group. Furthermore, in the autistic group the homophone meaning generation test, associated with mental flexibility mechanism, correlated with novel metaphors understanding, which do not rely on prior knowledge. In the learning disabilities group, conventional metaphors understanding correlated with the homophone meaning generation test.}

Results of a multi-phase qualitative analysis reveal two themes evident in the child’s thinking structures across the sessions: (a) Gina’s accommodations over time versus traditional progressions, and (b) Persistent factors that interacted with the child’s reasoning. Throughout the analysis, we raise questions about the child’s reasoning and what the child’s apparent knowing and learning was relying upon. When well-intentioned researchers or educators provide children interventions that promote procedures and replication of teacher-taught strategies, not only are they not serving their children’s mathematics learning needs, they may be preventing them from engaging in, reflecting upon, and coordinating actions that support the children to accommodate their thinking structures and advance their learning.

EBR predicted flexibility in divergent thinking and convergent thinking, but in different ways. The relationship with flexibility was independent of intelligence and followed an inverted U-shape function with medium EBR being associated with greatest flexibility. Convergent thinking was positively correlated with intelligence but negatively correlated with EBR, suggesting that higher dopamine levels impair convergent thinking. These findings support the claim that creativity and dopamine are related, but they also call for more conceptual differentiation with respect to the processes involved in creative performance.}

abstract = {Highly metamorphic coal plays a significant role in China's energy development plan owing to its high calorific value. Its complex organic composition provides outstanding storage capabilities for methane (clean and efficient unconventional natural gas), which leads to terrible gas outburst hazards. Minimizing the main storage sites of CH4 (micropores) through organic solvent extraction provides an efficient and safe route for exploiting coal and natural gas energy sources. This phenomenon can be elucidated by the removal of the chemical components that have an adverse impact on the micropore filling theory. In this study, we constructed macromolecular models of highly metamorphic coal, and relative dynamic simulations under experiment and field conditions are performed. The corresponding CH4 storage capacity and spatial coordination distribution of the coal after five treatments were derived. Combined with the results of the micropore filling theory, it was shown that the equilibrium distance of CH4 filling in the micropore increased with the degree of extraction (from 0.351 nm for XT to 0.572 nm for XT-DMF). Also, the trend of CH4 adsorption position in the representative samples (the number of monolayer affixations decreased from 10 to 9) provides crucial support for the conclusions, and the low-potential region with a high potential difference contributes to CH4 stability. The breakthrough of this study will provide strong support and a solid theoretical basis for the efficient and safe exploitation of CBM (Coalbed methane) energy resources.}

However, few studies to date have defined problem solving, and investigated how it is operationalised in interdisciplinary creative coding tasks. This study aims to build knowledge about students’ use of computational thinking and computer science concepts for problem solving when coding animated narratives. The research investigated students’ coding processes using data gathered from audio and device display recordings and semi-structured interviews. Results suggest limitations to the use of creative coding tasks if the expectation is to develop computational thinking and systematic problem solving strategies, or learn basic computer science concepts. They revealed that novice students rarely solved coding problems using optimal technically-based strategies despite being given explicit instruction on their use, opting instead to bypass problems by adjusting intended outcomes, or by using low level code translation strategies. Results demonstrate that engaging computational thinking or even demonstrating understanding of basic computer science concepts was not a requirement to produce a viable creative coding outcome. This study contributes new understanding of students’ coding practices when engaged in creative coding tasks in regular, non-specialist classrooms. Its findings challenge the commonly-held assumption that coding is a natural ‘vehicle’ to develop computational thinking and systematic approaches to problem solving. It also questions the learning that results from the non-technical, inefficient and often ineffective problem solving practices students employ during ‘creative coding’ tasks, that are frequently used by non-specialist teachers in response to curriculum requirements.}

That allowed evaluation of new games not yet played and later led to a more abstract conception of probability as a measure satisfying certain conditions (‘axioms’). Only in the past 150 years or so has probability had a major role in science and only in the last 50 years or so in everyday life – as, for example, in evaluating medical outcomes or technological risks or manufacturer liability. Thus, especially in attempting to assess probability in everyday situations, our intuitions are often deficient – more so than those concerning quantity, space, and time. The major problem is not, however, one of making random errors in probability judgments but of making systematic ones that result from a number of well-known and research systematic cognitive biases and heuristics, which are described in this article. These systematic departures from rational assessment do not imply that coherent and accurate probabilistic thinking is (anywhere near) impossible, but that when departures from coherence and accuracy occur, they tend to follow a predictable pattern.}

A posed problem involves a functional relationship when a mathematical function is the basis of the problem. We also found a mismatch between the problems that the students generated and those that their teachers predicted they would pose. Compared to the actual problems posed by the students, the problems predicted by the teachers were more likely to involve functional relationships about the pattern and less likely to involve a particular term in the pattern.

In this research we combine the use of value functions and fuzzy assessment to assess a functional and system architecture. There are several benefits of a methodology that combines value-focused thinking and fuzzy assessment. A distinct advantage of the methodology presented is the explicit inclusion of the customer in the assessment process through validation of the TPM value functions Involving the customer in TPM value function development and validation ensures the customer has direct input regarding the TPMs and their associated value across the range of discourse The methodology presented is flexible enough to assess architectures early in the process when things are “fuzzy” as well as later when subsystem and component performance are well defined. The methodology can also be used to analyze and assess impacts of interface changes within the system architecture. . The methodology is domain independent and can be coupled with executable models linked to scenarios. The assessment methodology is applied to the architecture for a soldier knowledge acquisition system for which the key performance attributes are affordability, performance, flexibility, updateability, and availability.}

Humans discount the value of future rewards over time. Here we show using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and neural coupling analyses that episodic future thinking reduces the rate of delay discounting through a modulation of neural decision-making and episodic future thinking networks. In addition to a standard control condition, real subject-specific episodic event cues were presented during a delay discounting task. Spontaneous episodic imagery during cue processing predicted how much subjects changed their preferences toward more future-minded choice behavior. Neural valuation signals in the anterior cingulate cortex and functional coupling of this region with hippocampus and amygdala predicted the degree to which future thinking modulated individual preference functions. A second experiment replicated the behavioral effects and ruled out alternative explanations such as date-based processing and temporal focus. The present data reveal a mechanism through which neural decision-making and prospection networks can interact to generate future-minded choice behavior.}

In addition to physical security, cyber security becomes a significant concern for NPPs since swift digitalization and overreliance on computer-based systems in the facility operations transformed NPPs into targets for cyber/physical attacks. Despite technical competencies, humans are still the central component of a resilient NPP to develop an effective nuclear security culture. Turkey is one of the newcomers in the nuclear energy industry, and Turkish Akkuyu NPP has a unique model owned by an international consortium. Since Turkey has limited experience in nuclear energy industry, specific multinational and multicultural characteristics of Turkish Akkuyu NPP also requires further research in terms of the Facility's prospective nuclear security. Yet, the link between “national cultures” and “nuclear security” is underestimated in nuclear security studies. By relying on Hofstede's national culture framework, our research aims to address this gap and explore possible implications of cross-national cultural differences on nuclear security. To cope with security challenges in the age of hybrid threats, we propose a security management model which addresses the need for cyber-physical security integration to cultivate a robust nuclear security culture in a multicultural working environment.}

Lessons emphasized melody, rhythm or form; in half of the classes, the teacher made the musical-mathematical parallels explicit. Apart from the specific musical-mathematical foci, the lesson content was kept as constant as possible within primary school settings. Pre-tests and post-tests in musical, creative, spatial and mathematical thinking were administered. Statistical analyses will examine improvement over time while considering differences among three musical components and two conditions for each. This research addresses concerns that governments’ quests for higher standards in mathematics may result in impoverished curricula with limited access to the arts.

However, little is known yet on how to apply circular economy thinking to sustainable campus management. In an attempt to address this gap, this paper proposes a methodological framework and guidance to help universities develop a circular economy strategy aimed at improving resource efficiency and environmental sustainability of their campus operations. The approach is compatible with sustainability management frameworks as it follows the well-known iterative process of planning, doing, checking and improving. The framework involves three main steps: analysis of current situation with respect to circular economy within the organisation; stakeholder engagement to get a buy-in and inform the development of a circular economy strategy; and implementation of the strategy following the guidelines provided within the framework. Application of the framework is illustrated through a case of the University of Manchester, demonstrating how circular economy principles can be used to benchmark existing sustainability policies and action plans. The paper also shows how engaging key stakeholders can be used to identify challenges and opportunities for embedding circular economy thinking into the university's sustainability management systems. The proposed framework and the guidelines for implementation of circular economy thinking are generic and can be applied by any institution across the higher education sector.}

The present study investigated whether different executive processes (i.e., updating, shifting, and inhibition) specifically contribute to the serial order effect in DT. Participants' executive functions were measured by corresponding experimental tasks outside of the EEG lab. They were required to generate original uses of conventional objects (alternative uses task) during EEG recording. The behavioral results revealed that the originality of ideas was higher in later stage of DT (i.e., Epoch 2) than in its earlier stage (i.e., Epoch 1) for higher-shifting individuals, but showed no difference between two epochs for lower-shifting individuals. The EEG results revealed that lower-inhibition individuals showed stronger upper alpha (10–13Hz) synchronization in left frontal areas during Epoch 1 compared to during Epoch 2. For higher-inhibition individuals, no changes in upper alpha activity from Epoch 1 to Epoch 2 were found. These findings indicated that shifting and inhibition contributed to create a serial order effect in DT, perhaps because individuals suppress interference from obvious ideas and switch to new idea categories during DT, thus more original ideas appear as time passes by.}

By offloading computation-intensive tasks to Mobile Edge Cloud Computing (MEC) servers at the network’s edge, businesses can achieve real-time data processing and analysis, reducing communication latency, quicker response times, and improved system reliability. This work presents an integrated framework for MEC and Industry 5.0, aimed at enhancing the performance, efficiency, and flexibility of industrial processes. In particular, we propose a joint optimization problem that maximizes computational energy efficiency by optimally allocating resources, such as processing power and computational resources, as well as device association, in the most efficient manner possible. The problem is formulated as nonconvex/nonlinear, which is intractable and poses high complexity. To solve this challenging problem, we first transform and decouple the original optimization problem into a series of subproblems using the block coordinate descent method. Then, we iteratively obtain an efficient solution using convex optimization methods. In addition, our work sheds light on the fundamental trade-off between local computation and partial offloading schemes. The results show that for small data size requirements, the performance is comparable among different schemes. However, as data size increases, our proposed hybrid scheme, which includes a partial offloading scheme, outperforms others, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed joint optimization scheme.}

abstract = {Background
The World Health Organization has identified cognitive determinants of hand hygiene as an outstanding research question. This study investigated whether doctors' preferences for a rational thinking style or an experiential thinking style are associated with hand hygiene compliance.
Methods
This was an observational study of hand hygiene practices of 32 doctors in 2 teaching hospitals in South Australia. Compliance rates were correlated with self-reported thinking styles. The doctors were observed by a trained observer during a ward round or outpatient clinic and were unaware that hand hygiene was under observation. The main outcome measures were hand hygiene compliance (hand hygiene compliance tool) and thinking style (Rational-Experiential Inventory).
Results
An overall mean compliance rate of 7.6% (standard deviation ± 7.2%) was found. Compliance was significantly positively correlated with experiential/automatic thinking (r = .46; P = .004) and the observational setting of ward rounds (vs clinics) (r = -.47; P = .003). No significant relationship was found between compliance and a rational/deliberate thinking style (r = -.01; P = .472).
Conclusions
Hand hygiene is more experiential than rational. Findings suggest that certain promotional strategies appealing to the experiential thinking mode may improve compliance, and that traditional approaches based on logic and reasoning alone probably will not work.}

Plausibly, resistance to scientific conclusions regarding the origins of species—like much resistance to other scientific conclusions (Bloom & Weisberg, 2007)—gains support from reliably developing intuitions. Intuitions about essentialism, teleology, agency, and order may combine to make creationism potentially more cognitively attractive than evolutionary concepts. However, dual process approaches to cognition recognize that people can often analytically override their intuitions. Two large studies (total N=1324) found consistent evidence that a tendency to engage analytic thinking predicted endorsement of evolution, even controlling for relevant demographic, attitudinal, and religious variables. Meanwhile, exposure to religion predicted reduced endorsement of evolution. Cognitive style is one factor among many affecting opinions on the origin of species.}

abstract = {It seems that neurotypical individuals (people without autism) have a hidden ability for savant-like skills, and these special abilities can be accessible via top-down cortical disinhibition of the left fronto-temporal lobe by repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). It is well known that enhanced visual function in striate and extrastriate areas is a common character in autists, savants and subjects with Asperger syndrome. In addition, visual cortex not only processes visual signals but also is involved in the processing of mathematical thinking and auditory signals among them. Here we argue about the essential (and more ancient) role of picture representation over linguistic representation in ASD and that extraordinary savant-like skills are due to the explicit predominance of the right hemisphere (a malfunction of top-down control processes) accompanied with prevalence of lower level detailed visual information in the right hemisphere. Our recently presented novel biophysical picture representation hypothesis (also called as intrinsic biophysical virtual visual reality) about visual perception and imagery is also briefly described and linked to the predominance of lower level and detailed visual representation in the right hemisphere that may be a common character in autism, savantism, and Asperger syndrome.}

Although this heuristic bias is well documented and widely featured in psychology textbooks, its precise nature is less clear. A key question is whether reasoners detect the biased nature of their judgments. My research is focusing on this detection process. In a nutshell, results indicate that despite their illogical response, people demonstrate a remarkable sensitivity to possible conflict between their heuristic judgment and elementary logical or probabilistic principles. In this chapter, I present a detailed overview of the empirical studies that I have run and discuss theoretical implications. I will clarify why the empirical detection findings have led me to hypothesize that people not only have heuristic intuitions but also logical intuitions. I also explore implications for ongoing debates concerning our view of human rationality (“Are humans blind and ignorant heuristic thinkers?”), dual process theories of reasoning (“How do intuitive and deliberate thinking interact?”), and the nature of individual differences in bias susceptibility (“when and why do biased and unbiased reasoners start to diverge?”).}

We explore a computational role for arousal systems in facilitating internal state transitions that facilitate credit assignment and promote accurate perceptions in nonstationary environments. We summarize recent work supporting this idea and highlight open questions, as well as alternative views of how arousal affects cognition.}

Extensive work has examined the relationship between rumination, a form of RNT, and EF in adults. However, less is known about the relationship between RNT more broadly and EF in youth, for whom these constructs are developing and emerging. Here, we systematically and qualitatively reviewed 27 studies on the associations between EF (e.g., shifting, inhibition, working memory) and RNT (e.g., rumination, worry, obsessions) in youth. All forms of RNT were more commonly positively associated with questionnaire-reported EF problems in daily life, most frequently in the domain of shifting. Task-based assessments of EF were less consistently associated with RNT in youth, with no strong pattern of presence vs. absence of associations. Further, limited longitudinal work has been conducted on this topic to date. This review integrates initial work with regard to RNT and EF deficits in a still-developing population, and discusses clear future need for longitudinal, multi-method assessments of the relationship between RNT and EF subtypes in youth.}

abstract = {With projections indicating an increase in mobility over the next few decades and annual flight departures expected to rise to over 16 billion by 2050, there is a demand for the aviation industry and associated stakeholders to consider new forms of aircraft and technology. Customer requirements are recognized as a key driver in business. The airline is the principal customer for the aircraft manufacture. The passenger is, in turn, the airline's principal customer but they are just one of several stakeholders that include aviation authorities, airport operators, air-traffic control and security agencies. The passenger experience is a key differentiator used by airlines to attract and retain custom and the fuselage that defines the cabin envelope for the in-flight passenger experience and cabin design therefore receives significant attention for new aircraft, service updates and refurbishments. Decision making in design is crucial to arriving at viable and worthwhile cabin formats. Too little innovation will result in an aircraft manufacturer and airlines using its products falling behind its competitors. Too much may result in an over-extension with, for example, use of immature technologies that do not have the necessary reliability for a safety critical industry or sufficient value to justify the development effort. The multiple requirements associated with cabin design, can be viewed as an area for optimisation, accepting trade-offs between the various parameters. Good design, however, is often defined as developing a concept that resolves the contradictions and takes the solution towards a win-win scenario. Indeed our understanding and practice of design allows for behaviors that enhance design thinking through divergence and convergence, the use of abductive reasoning, experimentation and systems thinking. This paper explores and defines the challenges of designing the aircraft cabin of the future that will deliver on the multiple requirements using experiences from the A350 XWB and future cabin design concepts. In particular the paper explores the value of implementing design thinking insights in engineering practice and discusses the relative merits of decisions based on optimisation versus win-win scenarios for aircraft cabin design and wider applications in aerospace environments. The increasing densification of technological opportunities and shifting consumer demand coupled with highly complex systems may ultimately challenge our ability to make decisions based on optimisation balances. From an engineering design perspective optimisation tends to preclude certain strategies that deliver high quality results in consumer scenarios whereas win-win solutions may face challenges in complex technical environments.}

abstract = {Although there have been many educational programs focusing on the creation of new ideas, the assessment of novelty is still a controversial issue. As an ideation tool, analogical thinking enables conceptual change, which is seen as a crucial aspect of creativity. In this regard, the use of analogy can be an important instrument to facilitate novel idea generation. Analogies are generated by superficial or structural similarities from the memory. For creating a new idea by analogy, this study regards novelty as the domain-changing influenced by structural consistency with the source ideas. Consequently, we designed an assessment framework based on the latent semantic analysis of the domains and the consistency of the underlying mechanism between the source and the new ideas. Data was collected from the 14 subjects who participated in the workshop for this study. The workshop consists of three tasks: 1) Pre-task: All subjects were asked to read the 25 cases of the collective intelligence services, which is a business model creating value from large and loosely organized groups of people working together electronically e.g. Amazon.com, Google Japanese input; 2) Categorization task: Subjects were asked to categorize each case based on the underlying mechanism of the business through group discussion; 3) Generation task: Subjects were asked to create a new service idea individually using analogical thinking. As a result, 12 ideas were created, 6 of which were assessed as novel according to our assessment framework. Among the remaining 6 ideas, 4 were assessed as having high superficial similarity in terms of the idea domain, and 2 as having neither superficial nor structural similarity with the source ideas. Although our findings suggest that the proposed assessment framework for novelty evaluation is unable to provide a ‘one-size fits-all method’, it does enable us to overcome some of the limitations of current evaluation methods which depend on subjective judgements for rating.}

The inclusion of digital Game-Based Learning (GBL) has shown great potential. To better understand how it can be helpful to adult learners in STEM degrees, a study was conducted on the application of two very popular commercial video games in different introductory programming courses at an online university, during the introduction of basic programming topics (CS1). The methods combined a descriptive qualitative and a quantitative approach, using a reflective journals and questionnaires, which helped students consider and express their experiences, how they interacted with the games, how the games helped them better understand the topics, and realize their personal progress and potential. Results showed that the use of these games as educational resources had a positive impact in their engagement and sense of self-efficacy, but only if some important instructional considerations are taken into account.}

We collected 30 computational kits, including 13 physical kits, 8 virtual kits, and 9 hybrid kits, and performed a qualitative analysis of these kits. We examined the kits across four different perspectives: how they are designed, how they support children to explore computational concepts and practices, how they enable children to engage in a range of projects and activities, and how they enable children to explore other domains of knowledge. Based on the analysis, we present design suggestions and opportunities to expand the possibilities in what computational ideas and other domains of knowledge children can explore, how children can engage in computing, and what kinds of projects children can make. While many kits enable the exploration of some computational concepts and practices, we see opportunities to expand how these concepts can be supported, as well as the new concepts and domains children could explore. We also see possibilities to include new modes of expression such as body motion or new media such as light and sound. Finally, we see possibilities for whom designers can better support, such as more explicit roles for adult caregivers and expanding possibilities for children from underrepresented groups in computing. This qualitative study reveals the commonalities across existing kits and highlights ways for designers and researchers to expand the possibilities for children to create, explore, and play with computing.}

Among those who met remission status on the Children’s Depression Rating Scale – Revised (CDRS-R≤28; 56 at week 12, 79 at week 18) extreme thinking did not predict failure to maintain remission. This is in contrast to findings with depressed adults. Treatment influenced level of extreme thinking, and this appeared to be driven by greater endorsement of positively valenced beliefs as opposed to a decrease in negatively valenced beliefs. Developmental or investigation characteristics may account for the discrepancy in findings.}

In natural settings, hillslope hydrology is challenged by the interplay of several factors, such as, heterogeneous morphology, vegetation, and complex soils. Herein, we attempt to clarify the mechanisms that control the rainfall-runoff relationship by investigating the response of an artificial outdoor slope setup with uniform geometry, soil properties, topography, and in the absence of vegetation located in a Mediterranean climate. Based on the analysis of more than 100 storms across six consecutive hydrological years, our results demonstrate that either pre-event soil water content or rainfall conditions alone are not sufficient to explain the slope response. Seasonality played a major role through soil moisture conditions, and pre-event soil moisture, peak rainfall intensity and rainfall duration influenced the slope runoff response. Observations suggest that in fall and winter subsurface flow was the prevalent runoff mechanism, while infiltration excess overland flow mostly occurred in the dry season. Our findings show that continuous measurement of runoff could be beneficial to understand the peak rainfall-peak runoff relationship.}

None of the many conceptual paradigms that have been proposed so far to explain it has turned out entirely satisfactory. We argue that the main reason behind this failure is the implicit linear thinking that informs all these approaches: namely, the idea that a few, major drivers explain urban development through a direct, clearly readable systemic impact. Cities are complex socio-environmental systems whose functioning depends on the concurrent interaction of many different factors which cannot be reduced to the action of a few, simple causal forces. Failing to understand such complexity easily leads to dysfunctional urban governance approaches. In this paper, we analyze a database of 144 European cities as described by 58 variables belonging to different domains, as designed by a preliminary stage of the Cultural and Creative City Monitor (CCCM). Our analysis builds on innovative machine learning techniques (PST) and on the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) representation to map the structural interdependencies between the cultural and non-cultural sectors in cities with a strong cultural policy orientation. This toolbox carries considerable potential for precision cultural policies and data-driven urban governance strategies of the future.}

While most of this literature focuses on domain specific relations (i.e., how math anxiety impacts thinking about mathematics), in the current work we examine important relations between math anxiety and domain general factors. Specifically, we test three hypotheses: (1) that higher-math-anxious individuals have a lower need for and enjoyment of exerting cognitive effort, (2) that math anxiety mediates a relation between ones’ propensity for cognitive effort and their achievement in mathematics, and (3) that higher-math-anxious individuals are less reflective in their thinking, and that this is not limited to questions that are heavily reliant on mathematical reasoning. As predicted, we uncovered relations between math anxiety and the domain-general constructs of need for cognition and cognitive reflection. Importantly, these negative relations hold even after controlling for math ability, general anxiety, and gender of the participant. The results are discussed in terms of implications for our understanding of the construct of math anxiety. Proficiency in mathematics is a major advantage in industrialised nations. Unfortunately, many people experience math-anxiety (Richardson & Suinn, 1972), becoming nervous when engaging in math tasks and avoiding math and math-related professions. As a result, those with math anxiety tend to severely limit their future career and earning opportunities (Chipman, Krantz, & Silver, 1992; Hembree, 1990). The resulting shortage of adults prepared to work in the sciences, technology, engineering, and mathematics field (STEM) has negative consequences at the national level, particularity as societies become increasingly dependent upon technology (Beilock & Maloney, 2015; Chipman et al., 1992; Maloney & Beilock, 2012). Worldwide, increased math-anxiety is linked to decreased math achievement (Foley et al., 2017; Lee, 2009), and this is not limited to academic situations. Math-anxious nurses, for example, are more likely than non-math-anxious nurses to make poor drug calculations (Mcmullan, Jones, & Lea, 2012); math-anxious women are more likely than their peers to engage in poor financial planning (McKenna & Nickols, 1988), and math anxiety is negatively linked to the ability to interpret health statistics (Silk & Parrott, 2014). Given that math-anxiety is related to important and detrimental consequences in people’s daily lives, it is vital that we work to understand the behavioural and cognitive differences between those who are high and low in math-anxiety.}

abstract = {The major energy-producing reactions of biochemistry occur at biological membranes. Computational protein design now provides the opportunity to elucidate the underlying principles of these processes and to construct bioenergetic pathways on our own terms. Here, we review recent achievements in this endeavour of ‘synthetic bioenergetics’, with a particular focus on new enabling tools that facilitate the computational design of biocompatible de novo integral membrane proteins. We use recent examples to showcase some of the key computational approaches in current use and highlight that the overall philosophy of ‘surface-swapping’ — the replacement of solvent-facing residues with amino acids bearing lipid-soluble hydrophobic sidechains — is a promising avenue in membrane protein design. We conclude by highlighting outstanding design challenges and the emerging role of AI in sequence design and structure ideation.}

abstract = {In this paper we build on a conceptual framing of computational empowerment that seeks to provide alternative endpoints for computer science (CS) education beyond degree attainment and job placement. But, as opposed to a teleological framing that prioritizes ends, we propose using the metaphor of trading zones to construct a framing for computational empowerment that is based on collaborative multi-directional exchanges of resources and knowledge between people with different expertise. This leaves the co-design and implementation of CS education open to emergent directions and possibilities. Using a descriptive case study methodology, we detail trading zones in two different co-design projects that sought to situate CS education in relationship to cultural contexts through multi-directional exchanges of resources and knowledge: (1) a co-design project in a youth boxing gym with coaches, mentors, and staff; (2) a co-design project in a high school barbering program with a barbering instructor and barbering students. Our findings show that the metaphor is useful for the concept of computational empowerment in ways that are reflexive and interventionist.}

Improving population health requires understanding and changing societal structures and functions, but countervailing forces sometimes undermine those changes, thus reflecting the adaptive complexity inherent in public health systems. The purpose of this paper is to propose systems thinking as a conceptual rubric for the practice of team science in public health, and transdisciplinary, translational research as a catalyst for promoting the functional efficiency of science. The paper lays a foundation for the conceptual understanding of systems thinking and transdisciplinary research, and will provide illustrative examples within and beyond public health. A set of recommendations for a systems-centric approach to translational science will be presented.}

abstract = {Scenario planning methods tend to work at an aggregate level and to consider homogeneous populations, thus levelling the variable effects of future developments on different social groups. Decision-making based on such scenarios bears the risk of missing undesired impacts on specific groups of people, which may cause social tensions or require costly countermeasures. New approaches are needed to provide a better basis for socially responsible planning by making clearer the complex social impacts of future scenarios. In marketing and user-centered design, persona models are developed to represent typologies of users to cover a broad range of needs and requirements. We propose a systematic method, called the Scenario Personarrative method, for combining scenario thinking and personas into a structured but nonetheless flexible process, which allows generating fine-grained individualized narratives. We describe a pilot application in a case study on urban mobility. This pilot used existing scenarios and focused on a two-hour workshop where twelve experts created personas and the associated narratives across three scenarios of urban mobility in 2030. This pilot shows the applicability of the method for making potential effects on different social groups more tangible. We propose ways forward for further evaluation of the proposed methodology.}

abstract = {Geographic information science can be defined as the study of the fundamental issues of geographic information, and is often motivated by the need to improve geographic information technologies. One such issue concerns the design of the user interface, and the relationship between the tasks performed by the technologies on the one hand, and the concepts that humans use in thinking about those tasks on the other. Nowhere is this issue more important than in the design of GIS user interfaces and functionality. Recent efforts have led to a comprehensive understanding of the concepts of spatial thinking, and of how these concepts might form the basis for a much-improved functionality and user interface. The presentation summarizes those efforts, and points to a future in which GIS will be much easier to teach, master, and use.}

abstract = {People often rely on intuitive judgments at the expense of deliberate reasoning, but what determines the dominance of intuition over deliberation is not well understood. Here, we employed a psychopharmacological approach to unravel the role of two major endocrine stress mediators, cortisol and noradrenaline, in cognitive reasoning. Healthy participants received placebo, cortisol (hydrocortisone) and/or yohimbine, a drug that increases noradrenergic stimulation, before performing the cognitive reflection test (CRT). We found that cortisol impaired performance in the CRT by biasing responses toward intuitive, but incorrect answers. Elevated stimulation of the noradrenergic system, however, had no effect. We interpret our results in the context of the dual systems theory of judgment and decision making. We propose that cortisol causes a shift from deliberate, reflective cognition toward automatic, reflexive information processing.}
