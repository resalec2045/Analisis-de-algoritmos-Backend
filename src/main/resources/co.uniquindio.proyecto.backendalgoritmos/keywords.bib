  keywords = {self-regulated learning, computational thinking, secondary school},
  abstract = {In this theoretical paper, we compare computational thinking and
self-regulated learning. Many studies use self-regulated learning to
foster the acquisition of computational thinking competencies. Self-
regulated learning skills are themselves beneficial for any learning
process; here, we argue that the relationship between self-regulated
learning and computational thinking is closer than the simple ob-
servation that self-regulated learning strategies support the acqui-
sition of computational thinking competencies. We sustain that
self-regulated learning and computational thinking competencies
share many features (and have some differences), which would
support synergistic effects so that not only can self-regulated learn-
ing be used to attain computational thinking competencies, but
computational thinking activities can also be used to foster features
of self-regulated learning competencies.},

  title = {Matrix Structures and Matrix Functions},
  year = {2023},
  location = {Norway},
  keywords = {structured matrices, matrix functions},
  abstract = {Structured matrices play a relevant role in symbolic and numerical
computations. In the literature and in applications we encounter
several types of structure, which are typically related to the prop-
erties of the problems they stem from: banded structure is often
associated with locality of functions or operators, Toeplitz struc-
ture arises from shift invariance properties, off-diagonal low-rank
structure appears in inverses of banded matrices.
A common trait of most matrix structures is the availability
of fast algorithms that perform fundamental operations, such as
matrix-vector or matrix-matrix multiplication, solution of linear
systems, or eigenvalue computation. For problems of large size,
such algorithms are extremely useful both from a symbolic and a
numeric point of view, although of course in a numerical setting
one needs to pay attention to possible stability issues.
The tutorial will start with a brief overview of matrix structures
and of their properties: we are especially interested here in rank
structures and in certain forms of sparsity. We will then focus
on selected topics concerning the analysis and computation of
functions of structured matrices. Functions of matrices have a wide
range of applications, for which we will give several examples, from
the solution of differential equations to network analysis. Think for
instance of the matrix exponential exp(A): it appears in the solution
of a multidimensional Cauchy problem with coefficient matrix A,
but it also has a combinatorial meaning when A is the adjacency
matrix of a graph. If the quantity of interest is the action of a matrix
function on a vector, moreover, one can often bypass the explicit
construction of the matrix function itself and devise a more efficient
approach.
Most methods for the computation of matrix functions are ulti-
mately based on polynomial or rational approximation, which are
either applied in explicit form, or through iterative methods such
as Lanczos or Arnoldi, often in combination with suitable pre- and
post-processing steps. If matrix A is structured, it is natural to ask
how to tailor such methods to the specific structure of A. We will
present a few possible answers to this question and demonstrate
their advantages through several practical examples.

  title = {Parallel Processing on Supercomputers: A Set of Computational},
  abstract = {One of the trends in supercomputer evolution lies 
in the direction of multiprocessor systems with in- 
creasing numbers of powerful processors. The user 
who is interested in attaining the maximum achiev- 
able computation rates on these machines must un- 
derstand the philosophy underlying the parallel pro- 
cessing mechanisms provided on them. This paper fo- 
cuses on the three types of parallelism currently avail- 
able on the Cray: vectorization, microtasking, and 
macrotasking. Experiences with all three constructs 
are presented with a view to exposing the improve- 
ments possible with each of them. While this paper 
deals with a particular machine, the Cray X-MP/48, 
many of the observations, comments, and conclusions 
derived can be generalized to other shared-memory 
multiprocessor systems.},

  title = {Don’t Block the Ground: Reducing Discomfort in Virtual Reality},
  year = {2021},
  location = {Virtual Event, USA},
  keywords = {virtual reality, field-of-view, cybersickness, postural stability},
  abstract = {Although virtual reality has been gaining in popularity, users con-
tinue to report discomfort during and after use of VR applications,
and many experience symptoms associated with motion sickness.
To mitigate this problem, dynamic field-of-view restriction is a com-
mon technique that has been widely implemented in commercial
VR games. Although artificially reducing the field-of-view during
movement can improve comfort, the standard restrictor is typically
implemented using a symmetric circular mask that blocks imagery
in the periphery of the visual field. This reduces users’ visibility of
the virtual environment and can negatively impact their subjective
experience. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a novel asymmet-
ric field-of-view restrictor that maintains visibility of the ground
plane during movement. We conducted a remote user study that
sampled from the population of VR headset owners. The experiment
used a within-subjects design that compared the ground-visible re-
strictor, the traditional symmetric restrictor, and a control condition
without FOV restriction. Participation required navigating through
a complex maze-like environment using a controller during three
separate virtual reality sessions conducted at least 24 hours apart.
Results showed that ground-visible FOV restriction offers benefits
for user comfort, postural stability, and subjective sense of pres-
ence. Additionally, we found no evidence of negative drawbacks to
maintaining visibility of the ground plane during FOV restriction,
suggesting that the proposed technique is superior for experienced
users compared to the widely used symmetric restrictor.},
