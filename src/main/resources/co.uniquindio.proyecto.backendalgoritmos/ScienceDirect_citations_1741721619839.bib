abstract = {Internet+ecosystems, big data applications, customers’ specific demands, and internal and external values integration of enterprises pose new challenges to inter-organizational collaborations in supply chain networks. To confront these challenges, this paper integrates computational experiment and data analysis, and proposes a methodology for data-driven computational experiments for inter-organizational collaborations in supply chain networks. It explores a paradigm shift to the development of data-driven computational experiments that supports decision making in the domain of inter-organizational collaborations. A basic principle for integrated solutions generation in the parallel worlds of virtual reality interaction is studied and the corresponding key issues in the paradigm are analyzed. To support the paradigm and solve key issues, a six-layered framework with four viewpoints for data-driven computational experiments is proposed. This framework systematically presents conceptual and technical solutions for data-driven computational experiments and decision support in the domain of inter-organizational collaborations in supply chain networks. The effectiveness of the framework is verified by theoretical analysis and a case study.}

abstract = {From a brain processing perspective, the perception of creative thinking is rooted in the underlying cognitive process, which facilitates exploring and cultivating novel avenues and problem-solving strategies. However, it is challenging to emulate the intricate complexity of how the human brain presents a novel way to uncover unique solutions. One potential approach to mitigating this complexity is incorporating creative cognition into the evolving artificial intelligence systems and associated neural models. Hopfield neural network (HNN) are commonly acknowledged as a simplified neural model, renowned for their biological plausibility to store and retrieve information, specifically patterns of neurons. Our findings suggest utilizing modern HNN to emulate creative thinking by making meaningful associations between seemingly disparate concepts. This semantic link is represented as a radio knob that can be set to determine whether the network solves problems creatively or shuts down; the threshold is a parameter. We used the term "first knob of creativity" to describe a certain pattern and utilized the "second knob of creativity" to aid in the examination of alternatives within the network. By manipulating the knobs, it is possible to selectively suppress specific patterns, facilitating the creative functioning of the HNN and identifying other patterns with which input can be linked.}

The importance of culturing and nourishing this individual to not only reach its potential but to pass its selected genetics on to progeny is paramount. Thus, all the investment in genetic improvement is now at the mercy of management. Once the goats are in the herd on the farm and the responsibility of the farmer or farm manager, the expression and proliferation of the genotype will be strongly influenced by environmental factors. If maximum milk production per lactation were the real and only goal that could promise farm business and land sustainability, genetic selection would be easy. However, the real goal on farms is to have healthy goats that produce efficiently and are adapted to their environment. This places the development of the goat breeding program in the hands of farmers. To aid farmers in moving beyond the use of total milk production per goat as the feedback mechanism to farm sustainability, the integration of more appropriate progress indicators could include longevity (which, in humans, is estimated at 20% genetic and 80% environmental), the amount of milk or milk component production per body weight of goat, and the degree of involuntary culling.}

abstract = {Discrete architecture is recognized as a computational design approach which uses computation to generate algorithmically combinable aggregations. It is therefore a promising innovation for increasing design process productivity through the adaptability of the aggregations it generates. In the built environment, discrete design is usually identified with the modular method. It is a construction process based on the aggregation of different modules assembled according to well-defined connections to ensure the building’s integrity and functionality. It involves off-site manufacturing, and hence a controlled environment ensuring more predictability over weathering and change. But like in conventional construction practices, the fragmentation of modular construction processes hinders its productivity. As a result, this construction approach requires adequate technologies and communication tools to improve collaboration and productivity. This paper aims to address these requirements by adopting a BIM-driven computational approach to design processes and a robotic approach to prefabrication processes. It proposes a modular construction framework for design and production, and presents the results through a study adopting BIM-driven discrete design and robotic manufacturing.}

To assess the viability of this scenario, we first review how a local cortical patch may be modeled as an attractor network, in which memory representations are not artificially stored as prescribed binary patterns of activity as in the Hopfield model, but self-organize as continuously graded patterns induced by afferent input. Recordings in macaques indicate that such cortical attractor networks may express retrieval dynamics over cognitively plausible rapid time scales, shorter than those dominated by neuronal fatigue. A cortical network encompassing many local attractor networks, and incorporating a realistic description of adaptation dynamics, may be captured by a Potts model. This network model has the capacity to engage long-range associations into sustained iterative attractor dynamics at a cortical scale, in what may be regarded as a mathematical model of spontaneous lateral thought.

abstract = {Respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), the increase and decrease in instantaneous heart rate (HR) with inspiration and expiration, is commonly evaluated as function of breathing frequency f. However, to the extent that RSA plays a role in the efficiency of gas exchange, it may be expected to correlate better with HR/f (‘breathing specific heart rate’) than with f, because the former is a better reflection of the cardio-respiratory coupling. We measured RSA breath-by-breath in 209 young men and women during spontaneous breathing and during volitional breathing under auditory cues at vastly different f. In either case, and for both genders, RSA correlated better with HR/f than with f. As HR/f increased so did RSA, in a linear manner. When compared on the basis of HR/f, RSA did not differ significantly between spontaneous and volitional breathing. It is proposed that RSA is a central mechanism that ameliorates the matching between the quasi-continuous pulmonary blood flow and the intermittent airflow, irrespective of the type of ventilatory drive (cortical or autonomic).}

The Hausdorff distance is used to measure the similarity between two point sets in various applications. However, it is hard to compute the HD algorithm efficiently between very large-scale point sets while ensuring the accuracy of the HD. The directed HD algorithm has two loops (called the outer loop and the inner loop) for calculating MAX-MIN distance, and the state-of-the-art algorithms, such as the Early break method and the Diffusion search method, focused on reducing the iterations of the inner loop. Our algorithm, however, concentrates on reducing the iterations of the outer loop. The proposed method simultaneously computes the temporary HD and temporary minimum distances of points corresponding to the outer loop using the opposite HD computation with very small systematic samples. Thereafter, a strategy of ruling out is employed to exclude non-contributing points. The new approach reduces the problems of different grid sizes and highly overlapping point sets as well as the very large-scale point sets. 3-D point clouds and real brain tumor segmentation (MRI 3-D volumes) are used for comparing the performance of the proposed algorithm and the state-of-the-art HD algorithms. In experimental results with 3-D point clouds, the proposed method is more than at least 1.5 times as faster as the compared algorithms. And, in experimental results with MRI 3-D volumes, the proposed method achieves a better performance than the compared algorithms over all pairs regardless of the grid size. Thus, as a whole, the proposed algorithm outperforms the compared algorithms.}

Utilizing large-scale, representative data from the International Computer and Information Literacy Study (ICILS) 2018 (15,015 teachers in 1195 schools in eight countries), we performed multilevel structural equation modeling and regression trees and found that teacher motivation and collaboration were positively and consistently linked to teaching practices across countries. Besides, principals' expectations concerning the teaching with technology explained variation in Finnish and German schools. In three countries, teachers' professional development was related to their teaching practices. Finally, countries’ economic development and innovation explained variation in the teacher-level effects.

abstract = {Background
In the United States, caregivers of people living with Alzheimer disease and Alzheimer disease–related dementias (AD/ADRD) provide >16 billion hours of unpaid care annually. These caregivers experience high levels of stress and burden related to the challenges associated with providing care. Social media is an emerging space for individuals to seek various forms of support.
Objective
We aimed to explore the primary topics of conversation on the social media site Reddit related to AD/ADRD. We then aimed to explore these topics in depth, specifically examining elements of social support and behavioral symptomology discussed by users.
Methods
We first generated an unsupervised topic model from 6563 posts made to 2 dementia-specific subreddit forums (r/Alzheimers and r/dementia). Then, we conducted a manual qualitative content analysis of a random subset of these data to further explore salient themes in the corpus.
Results
The topic model with the highest overall coherence score (0.38) included 10 topics, including caregiver burden, anxiety, support-seeking, and AD/ADRD behavioral symptomology. Qualitative analyses provided added context, wherein users sought emotional and informational support for many aspects of the care experience, including assistance in making key care-related decisions. Users expressed challenging and complex emotions on Reddit, which may be taboo to express in person.
Conclusions
Reddit users seek many different forms of support, including emotional and specific informational support, from others on the internet. Users expressed a variety of concerns, challenges, and behavioral symptoms to manage as part of the care experience. The unique (ie, anonymous and moderated) nature of the forum allowed for a safe space to express emotions free from documented caregiver stigma. Additional support structures are needed to assist caregivers of people living with AD/ADRD.}

The research sought to determine how group cohesiveness within Design Thinking (DT) phases influences CPS skills and to identify the characteristics of SSMR in high- versus low-creativity groups. Participants included 108 first-year undergraduate students majoring in humanities and social sciences at a South Korean university. The study found a significant relationship between group cohesiveness and CPS skill levels across various CPS phases. Specifically, substantial differences in SSMR patterns, particularly concerning exploration and evaluation, were observed among low- and high-creativity groups. These findings suggest that the interplay of divergent and convergent thinking during CPS is crucial for devising novel and practical solutions. Employing a mixed-methods approach and collaboration analysis, the study closely examined the CPS process using CSCL tools, offering valuable insights for informing future CPS instructional strategies.}

The design used in this assessment provides a framework for considering teacher development and student assessment simultaneously. Results show that students taught by project teachers performed better in both classroom problem-solving activities and task-based interviews than students taught by nonproject teachers. In addition, there were major differences in the problem-solving behaviors of the two groups. Experimental students (students of project teachers) displayed greater mathematical confidence, and were more likely to see mathematics as a powerful way of thinking about the real world and approach mathematics as such.}

abstract = {Marine spatial planning (MSP) is the dominant management tool for marine environments around the world and is an attempt to move beyond the sectoral governance of marine spaces. Scotland is no exception and MSP is central to its management plans. The interpretation and use of spatial data informs these plans and maps provide the backbone of the decision-making process. Whilst not refuting MSP as a governance tool, this paper examines more closely some of the inherent problems with representing marine environments spatially and how the practice of map-making inevitably interacts with social-ecological networks. Borrowing from critical cartography and Actor-Network Theory (ANT), four observations are made: 1) due to the necessary procedure of categorising and simplifying data, maps do not always accurately represent changeable marine environments and situations; 2) maps can produce reality as much as represent it; 3) mapping has become the point through which all actors and stakeholders must pass; 4) as they are obliged to pass through this point, the roles and definition of certain actors can change. This discussion of marine spatial planning in Scotland demonstrates what can be learnt from viewing marine spaces as a tightly coupled social-ecological environment.}

While past work has emphasized the information value of direct social interactions (such as watching someone help or hinder others), social tendencies can also be inferred from indirect evidence, such as how an agent considers others when making personal choices. Here we present a computational model of this capacity, grounded in a Bayesian framework for action understanding. Across four experiments we show that this model captures how people infer social preferences based on how agents act when their choices indirectly impact others (Experiments 1a, 1b, & 1c), and how people infer what an agent knows about others from knowledge of that agent’s social preferences (Experiment 2). Critically, people’s patterns of inferences could not be explained by simpler alternatives. These findings illuminate how people can discern potential social partners from indirect evidence of their prosociality, thus deepening our understanding of partner detection, and social cognition more broadly.}

abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) literacy education was previously taught primarily at the university and secondary school levels but has recently started to be expanded to primary school settings. When available at the primary school level, AI literacy is often taught within computer science courses, which may potentially reinforce gender stereotypes and discourage female students' engagement. In AI literacy education, the predominant teaching methods are constructivist approaches, which, while effective in fostering active learning, heavily emphasize technical skills and are therefore limited in their pedagogical scope, as they underplay other important questions, such as disinformation, data justice, and AI's ethical and societal implications. The lack of a clear definition of AI literacy for primary education also raises questions about what to teach and how to teach it. Additionally, little attention has been devoted to understanding gender differences in learning outcomes within AI literacy primary education. This study advocates the use of an arts-based transdisciplinary approach for teaching AI literacy to 25 primary school students. A pilot study utilizing mixed methods was conducted to assess the effectiveness of this arts-based approach. Quantitative analysis through a paired t-test revealed a statistically significant improvement in AI literacy among students participating in knowledge tests. Moreover, the results of the Mann‒Whitney and Kruskal‒Wallis tests indicated that gender and age did not impact pre- and post-knowledge test scores. Qualitative analyses further revealed the pedagogical benefits of the arts-based approach, demonstrating that students enhance their conceptual understanding of AI literacy by reflecting on their artifacts. This study contributes to the literature by providing evidence with a small sample size that the arts-based approach can overcome age and gender barriers to accessing AI literacy education and can serve as a means to teach AI thinking.}

abstract = {Research in computational psychiatry is dominated by models of behavior. Subjective experience during behavioral tasks is not well understood, even though it should be relevant to understanding the symptoms of psychiatric disorders. Here, we bridge this gap and review recent progress in computational models for subjective feelings. For example, happiness reflects not how well people are doing, but whether they are doing better than expected. This dependence on recent reward prediction errors is intact in major depression, although depressive symptoms lower happiness during tasks. Uncertainty predicts subjective feelings of stress in volatile environments. Social prediction errors influence feelings of self-worth more in individuals with low self-esteem despite a reduced willingness to change beliefs due to social feedback. Measuring affective state during behavioral tasks provides a tool for understanding psychiatric symptoms that can be dissociable from behavior. When smartphone tasks are collected longitudinally, subjective feelings provide a potential means to bridge the gap between lab-based behavioral tasks and real-life behavior, emotion, and psychiatric symptoms.}

Classical philosophy of formal languages as well as symbolic AI assume that all kinds of knowledge must explicitly be represented by formal or programming languages. This assumption is limited by recent insights into the biology of evolution and developmental psychology of the human organism. Most of our knowledge is implicit and unconscious. It is not formally represented, but embodied knowledge, which is learnt by doing and understood by bodily interacting with changing environments. That is true not only for low-level skills, but even for high-level domains of categorization, language, and abstract thinking. The embodied mind is considered an emergent capacity of the brain as a self-organizing complex system. Actually, self-organization has been a successful strategy of evolution to handle the increasing complexity of the world. Genetic programs are not sufficient and cannot prepare the organism for all kinds of complex situations in the future. Self-organization and emergence are fundamental concepts in the theory of complex dynamical systems. They are also applied in organic computing as a recent research field of computer science. Therefore, cognitive science, AI, and robotics try to model the embodied mind in an artificial evolution. The paper analyzes these approaches in the interdisciplinary framework of complex dynamical systems and discusses their philosophical impact.}

The most characterising and critical step along the Design Thinking process is the empathy phase, in which stakeholder analysis is performed by looking at a given scenario from the perspective of different stakeholders. Such a methodology enables a systematic information gathering and organization that results in a deep understanding of actual problems, needs and expectations from the target stakeholders. The uniqueness of problems and the need for situation-specific data makes knowledge re-use not always practical, even within the most consolidated and experienced environments. In this paper we propose an ontological support to empathy mapping that aims to (i) establish an interoperable fine-grained data layer among the different data collected throughout the empathy mapping process, (ii) enable multi-scenario analysis underpinned by formal specifications and (iii) further empower the process through semantic enrichment and integration of insight from multiple sources and contexts. We believe this is the first step to design and properly integrate effective computational and AI-based functionalities along the creative design thinking process, as well as to enable in practice richer and more sophisticated approaches (e.g. through social networks).}

It is associated with strong emotional responses of regret (when the obtained outcome is inferior to the counterfactual) and relief (vice versa). Counterfactual thinking may play a role in various cognitive phenomena in disordered gambling, such as the effects of near-misses. This study compared individuals with gambling disorder (n = 46) and healthy controls (n = 25) on a behavioural economic choice task that entailed choosing between two gambles, designed to measure counterfactual thinking. Participants provided affect ratings following both the obtained and the non-obtained outcomes. Choices were analyzed using a computational model that derived parameters reflecting sensitivity to expected value, risk variance, and anticipated regret. In the computational choice model, the group with gambling disorder showed increased sensitivity to anticipated regret, reduced sensitivity to expected value, and increased preference for high risk-variance gambles. On the affect ratings, the group with gambling disorder displayed blunted emotional sensitivity to obtained and counterfactual outcomes. Effect sizes of the group differences were modest. Participants with gambling disorder show wide-ranging alterations in decision-making processes and emotional reactivity to choice outcomes. Altered sensitivity to anticipatory regret in gambling disorder may contribute to the development of gambling-related cognitive distortions, and the influences of gambling marketing.}

A set-oriented perspective (Lockwood, 2014) is a way of thinking about counting problems that emphasizes the importance of reasoning about the set of outcomes being counted. From a set-oriented perspective, one possible type of intervention is to have students focus on the sets of outcomes rather than formulas and expressions, and specifically to reason about the structure of the set of outcomes. Yet, reasoning about sets of outcomes is not sufficient for students to make connections between outcomes and counting processes. In this paper, we investigate tasks where students wrote computer code to enumerate the set of outcomes in a specific order by implementing listing processes, and they were then asked to determine a specific numbered outcome in their list by using the structure of their enumeration scheme. We clarify particular aspects of a set-oriented perspective that were productive for students, and we demonstrate that tasks that asked students to name a specific outcome in their list elicited meaningful connections between counting processes and sets of outcomes. Further, such tasks reinforce desirable mathematical practices such as leveraging structure and connecting representations.}

Six individuals with a diagnosis of schizophrenia were identified in the Copenhagen High-Risk study and each pedigree was centered on one of the six original schizophrenic probands' nuclear families. The 329 pedigree members in the study were considered at risk for schizophrenia spectrum disorders because most were genetically related to the originating schizophrenic probands. The participants were administered the Copenhagen Interview of Functional Illness to determine diagnoses and the Thought Disorder Index (TDI) was used to assess FTD. Individuals with a schizophrenia diagnosis had higher global levels of FTD, exhibited more severe types of FTD, and had a qualitatively different type of FTD than did participants with other diagnoses or no mental illness. Individuals with Cluster A diagnoses exhibited more FTD and FTD similar in quality to participants with schizophrenia. These results support the construct of a spectrum of schizophrenia conditions. There was a generally high level of FTD in the pedigrees, in part due to assortative mating in this sample. However, there was no apparent pattern of linear aggregation of FTD within the families.}

Bugs are useful for describing how rational errors occur but bugs are not sufficient for explaining their origin. A possible explanation for this is that rational errors are the result of incorrect induction from examples. This prediction is termed the “induction hypothesis” (VanLehn, 1986). The purpose of the present study was to: (a) expand on post formulations of the induction hypothesis, and (b) use a new methodology to test the induction hypothesis more carefully than has been done previously. The first step involved teaching participants a new number system called NewAbacus, a written modification of the abacus system. The second step consisted of dividing them into different groups, where each individual received an example of only one port of the NewAbacus addition algorithm. During the third and final step, participants were instructed to solve both familiar and unfamiliar types of addition problems in NewAbacus. The induction hypothesis was supported by using both empirical and computational investigations.}

abstract = {The lattice theory under the framework of formal concept analysis has brought mathematical thinking to knowledge representation and discovery. In this respect, this mathematical framework offers a conceptual knowledge representation through the Galois lattice. This hierarchical conceptual structure has been beneficial within the task of knowledge discovery in databases. However, its effective use in large datasets is always limited by the overwhelming number of extracted formal concepts. To select interesting formal concepts, the stability measure can be of valuable help. The dedicated literature has highlighted non-scalable approaches to compute such a stability measure. In an effort to tackle this issue, we introduce the Dfsp algorithm dedicated to efficiently compute the quality measure of the stability of formal concepts. We also show that the stability computation is an instantiation of a larger issue: locating minimal generators given the closed pattern as a reference point. The guiding idea of the Dfsp algorithm is to maximize as far as possible the quantity of the useless search space through the swift localization of maximal non-generator cliques. The experiments performed demonstrate the efficiency of the Dfsp algorithm.}

abstract = {Gonorrhea is an urgent antimicrobial resistance threat and its therapeutic options are continuously getting restricted. Moreover, no vaccine has been approved against it so far. Hence, the present study aimed to introduce novel immunogenic and drug targets against antibiotic-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae strains. In the first step, the core proteins of 79 complete genomes of N. gonorrhoeae were retrieved. Next, the surface-exposed proteins were evaluated from different aspects such as antigenicity, allergenicity, conservancy, and B-cell and T-cell epitopes to introduce promising immunogenic candidates. Then, the interactions with human Toll-like receptors (TLR-1, 2, and 4), and immunoreactivity to elicit humoral and cellular immune responses were simulated. On the other hand, to identify novel broad-spectrum drug targets, the cytoplasmic and essential proteins were detected. Then, the N. gonorrhoeae metabolome-specific proteins were compared to the drug targets of the DrugBank, and novel drug targets were retrieved. Finally, the protein data bank (PDB) file availability and prevalence among the ESKAPE group and common sexually transmitted infection (STI) agents were assessed. Our analyses resulted in the recognition of ten novel and putative immunogenic targets including murein transglycosylase A, PBP1A, Opa, NlpD, Azurin, MtrE, RmpM, LptD, NspA, and TamA. Moreover, four potential and broad-spectrum drug targets were identified including UMP kinase, GlyQ, HU family DNA-binding protein, and IF-1. Some of the shortlisted immunogenic and drug targets have confirmed roles in adhesion, immune evasion, and antibiotic resistance that can induce bactericidal antibodies. Other immunogenic and drug targets might be associated with the virulence of N. gonorrhoeae as well. Thus, further experimental studies and site-directed mutations are recommended to investigate the role of potential vaccine and drug targets in the pathogenesis of N. gonorrhoeae. It seems that the efforts for proposing novel vaccines and drug targets appear to be paving the way for a prevention-treatment strategy against this bacterium. Additionally, a combination of bactericidal monoclonal antibodies and antibiotics is a promising approach to curing N. gonorrhoeae.}

The medial prefrontal cortex clearly distinguishes high level versus low level of strategic thinking, thus encoding the complexity underlying human social behavior.}

For this purpose, natural language processing approaches, including named entity recognition and structural topic modeling, are adopted. Based on this large-n selection procedure, selected topics related to the geographical political economy of the energy transition are reviewed in detail. The review maps the geographical scope and scale of the research field, highlights major topics, and shows the distribution of methodological approaches and the role of geographic information systems in this research field. The results show a growing body of literature attentive to socio-spatial variation and the uneven spatiality of energy systems. Nevertheless, uneven geographical distributions of studies with a strong focus on the major industrialized countries and generally only a few comparative cases were also found. In particular, research on the energy transition and renewable energy policy is strongly informed by studies addressing the Global North, limiting the evidence base for other regional contexts from the Global South.}

In this social neuroscience study, we scanned 121 vaccine-supporters using magnetoencephalography to evaluate three levels of polarisation: explicit, implicit, and neural — and then to test whether exposing people to extreme ingroup perspectives (following the paradoxical thinking principles) or extreme outgroup perspectives can modulate those levels of affective polarisation between vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. We show that a neural proxy for intergroup polarisation, expressed as late prefrontal beta rhythm suppression, can detect subtle changes in affective polarisation. More specifically, we find that exposing vaccine-supporters to extreme ingroup (i.e., pro-vaccination) viewpoints leads to a decrease in this neural proxy of affective polarisation. Conversely, exposure to extreme outgroup (i.e., anti-vaccination) narratives increases polarisation, which in turn predicts a decrease in positive affect towards vaccine opposers almost one year later. Altogether, the results show that although it may seem intuitive to expose people to counter-arguments (i.e., extreme outgroup perspectives) to change their opinions, such an approach can backlash and increase polarisation instead. However, using subtler methods such as the paradoxical thinking intervention (i.e., extreme ingroup perspectives) for attitude change can have the desired effects and reduce intergroup polarisation.}

They still lack the ‘magic’ of human-level cognition: systems built for one paradigm appear clueless outside of its boundary. Natural cognitive systems, on the other hand, can adapt to unexpected environments and paradigms. To capture the robustness of natural cognitive development, a new approach is proposed here that enables the formation of new higher cognitive abilities in a model system, embedded in an unexpected environment. This is achieved based on the naturally developing grounding of innate abstract constructs (schemas). The mechanism producing this binding is that of creative insight. In this study, principles of insight processes borrowed from psychology are formalized and adapted for computer modeling. To do this, several examples of insight phenomena at different evolutionary levels and in different species are analyzed before the model is formulated based on the dual process theory, the signal model of insight, and the eBICA cognitive architecture framework. Results of its computer simulations prove the concept. One specific finding is that the accumulation of activation during the incubation period increases creative abilities of the system. It is argued that the proposed approach can explain a range of facts and mysteries associated with the human cognitive ontogeny and can provide the basis for a self-sustained evolution of future Artificial Intelligence.}

This case study included 130 students with different programing preparation (authentic or traditional), who were exposed to computational learning modules. Control-Value Theory of Achievement Emotions is the conceptual framework that guided the evaluation of this investigation. Measures included student self-beliefs such as control and value appraisals, and their relationship with academic performance. Results suggest that programming preparation presented in an authentic engineering context provides an important foundation that goes beyond increasing students' control self-beliefs. This preparation seems to effectively enable students to leverage computational practices for the purpose of acquiring disciplinary concepts. Implications for teaching relate to the integration of computation sooner, more often and within a disciplinary context in the undergraduate engineering curriculum. Implications for learning relate to fostering engineering computational literacy guided by anchored instruction to support disciplinary problem solving.}

This chapter discusses the interaction of computational numerical with pure mathematics.. As far as computer scientists are concerned, their genuine “interface of interaction” with numerical thinking is in two distinct areas: complexity theory and high-performance computing. While complexity theory has always been a glamourous activity in theoretical computer science, it has only recently emerged as a focus of concerted activity in numerical circles, occasionally leading to a measure of acrimony. It is to be hoped that, eventually, computer scientists will find complexity issues involving real-number computations to be challenging, worthwhile, and central to the understanding of theoretical computation. Likewise, the ongoing development of parallel computer architectures and the computational grid is likely to lead to considerably better numerical/computational interaction at the more practical, engineering-oriented end.}

In this chapter, we investigate the generic representations of human functions and machine operations in the same framework for execution on the current computers, i.e., how a machine would execute human functions and conversely how a human would execute machine functions. This approach would facilitate the encoding of the (common) human functions as precisely as the machine language instructions for a computer. Conversely, the approach would facilitate the transfer of the lower-level intelligence of a human being into the adaptation of the HW, SW, and FW modules of an intelligent machine. Though not entirely feasible, the approach digs deep inroads in how human intelligent-machines can be and conversely, how robotic mundane-human beings can be. The later situation occurs in prisoner-, slave-, military-camps. The methodology is practical since machines have already started to imitate human behavior and some of the human tasks are routine and programmable into the robots. The challenge lies when some of the higher levels functions (such as conceptualize, hypothesize, optimize, generalize, axiomize, etc.) of human beings need to be programed into intelligent machines, even though middle level functions (such as summarize, generalize, rationalize, etc.) can be forced by appropriate knowledge-ware (KW) into intelligent machines. These middle level functions are encoded into the KW by searching for embedded knowledge centric objects (KCOs) in human beings, cultures, societies, and other contributing objects. Related and pertinent knowledge is found by exploring the local and the Internet knowledge bases (KBs) and selecting the attributes of these objects and or related objects. The Chapter outlines and elaborates the proposed approach.}

Given these properties, computational models of metacognition provide an empirically-tractable early step in characterizing the generative process that constructs qualitative experience.

This chapter focuses on harmonic mind and its structure, and its importance in everyday transfer thinking. The harmonic structure of higher level transfer thinking helps to efficiently store, integrate, remember, process, and retrieve information. Such a structure becomes a memory or mnemonic device for learning. This form of analogical transfer is also seen in the basic structure of higher level mathematical thinking. Thus it appears that transfer ability and mathematical ability are integrally related on some fundamental neurological level. Although analogical transfer ability, which is manifested mathematically in abstract proportional forms, is characteristic of all good mathematicians, those not skilled in higher mathematics may nevertheless be good at transfer thinking.}

Fourth and fifth graders tended to shift from the unit-rate strategy to other strategies if there was no easy way to calculate the unit-value directly from the context of the problems.

This new approach forces us to re-evaluate classical epistemic concepts like “truth”, “justification” etc. Furthermore, if thinking is believing, then it is not clear how thoughts can be modeled computationally.

abstract = {The saturated and unsaturated rings in the tautomers of (Z)-4-(hydroxyethyl) isochroman-1, 3-dione (EIC) and 4-acetyl-3-hydroxyisochroman-1-one (AOC) are found to be nonplanar. All the DFT and ab-initio computational methods with various basis sets identify EIC as the global minimum in S0. IRC and frequency computations locate the transition states (TS). AOC and TS are located about 3.5 ± 0.5 kcal/mole and 4.5 ± 0.8 kcal/mole higher in energy than EIC. The transition region is clearly marked with the evaluation of reaction force and force constants. CIS and TDDFT computations show inconsistent results. MHP is obeyed by the EIC tautomer, while MEP is obeyed by the TS structure. Frontier molecular orbitals confirms the S0 → S1 transition as π-π* in nature. The vibrational signatures in the tautomers corresponding to CO stretching modes and ring modes are identified. The earlier observed 1740 cm-1C = O stretching mode is computed to appear at 1763 cm−1 in EIC.}

The inference of parameters, the choice among competing models, and, first and foremost, the reliable construction of such models pose considerable challenges. Recent work in statistical inference, especially parameter estimation, and model selection, coupled to new computationally more efficient methods to simulate large (and stochastic) biochemical reaction systems will be pivotal for the generation of a new generation of whole cell models. But these need to be coupled to better ways of generating models de novo. I outline how this may be achieved, and why this is necessary.}

These models are commonly developed to provide decision-support tools for policymakers who are forced to make difficult decisions in a timely manner. Done properly, these models are able to provide a safe, quick, and cheap solution for this challenge. There are numerous types of mathematical models for epidemiological disease spread and control. However, in order to become applicative tools for decision-making, the modelers of these models are required to overcome three computational challenges: efficiently define the model, develop it as computer software, and fit it into historical data. Performed efficiently, one can use the obtained tool to explore possible scenarios and PIPs. In this paper, we present a critical review of models that extend the Susceptible–Infected–Recovered (SIR) model and explore the efficiency of these models, their software characteristics, and model performance on real-world data. We further provide a guide for epidemiological-mathematical model development and implementation, exploring several modeling approaches and their respective implementation options. Lastly, we outline the current trends, limitations, and opportunities in this field. In particular, we find that the spatial properties of a model play a critical role in its accuracy and ability to explain historical pandemic spread, especially in the context of airborne diseases. Moreover, we show that agent-based simulations are preferable over partial/ordinary differential solvers when considering a highly-realistic pandemic model or focusing on a relatively small population size.}

This is in line with philosophical approaches that consider an enactive self, constituted through action and interaction with the environment. We thereby analyze different definitions of the self and evaluate various computational theories lending to these ideas. Bayesian and predictive processing are promising approaches for computational modeling of the “active self”. We evaluate their implementation and challenges in computational psychiatry and cognitive developmental robotics. We describe how and why embodied robotic systems provide a valuable tool in psychiatry to assess, validate, and simulate mechanisms of self-disorders. Specifically, mechanisms involving sensorimotor learning, prediction, and self-other distinction, can be assessed with artificial agents.

abstract = {High-quality mesh surfaces are crucial for geometric processing in a variety of applications. To generate these meshes, polyhedral remeshing techniques truncate Voronoi cells of the original surface and yield precise intersections, but the calculation is complicated. Some methods apply auxiliary points to construct Voronoi diagrams to simplify these techniques, thereby extracting co-planar facets to approximate the original surface. However, extracting these approximate facets from the constructed Voronoi diagram makes it inefficient and non-parallelizable. To this end, we propose an efficient GPU method for manifold surface remeshing, where the restricted tangent face (RTF) is utilized to approximate the original surface. By intersecting the pre-clipped Voronoi cell with the tangent plane, this method directly calculates the RTF of each point without any auxiliary points or traversing Voronoi cells. Moreover, to restrict the movement of points, we introduce a projection method based on the KNN strategy, where each point is projected onto the triangular facet in the original surface. Owing to the independence and non-interference of the RTF computation and projection of each point, our method is implemented in parallel on the GPU. Experimental results on various mesh surfaces demonstrate the superior performance of our method in the viability, effectiveness, and efficiency.}

Running parallel to this trend are advances in programming environments and teaching methods which aim to make computer science more accessible, and more motivating. In this paper, we describe the design and evaluation of Flip, a programming language that aims to help 11–15 year olds develop computational skills through creating their own 3D role-playing games. Flip has two main components: 1) a visual language (based on an interlocking blocks design common to many current visual languages), and 2) a dynamically updating natural language version of the script under creation. This programming-language/natural-language pairing is a unique feature of Flip, designed to allow learners to draw upon their familiarity with natural language to “decode the code”. Flip aims to support young people in developing an understanding of computational concepts as well as the skills to use and communicate these concepts effectively. This paper investigates the extent to which Flip can be used by young people to create working scripts, and examines improvements in their expression of computational rules and concepts after using the tool. We provide an overview of the design and implementation of Flip before describing an evaluation study carried out with 12–13 year olds in a naturalistic setting. Over the course of 8 weeks, the majority of students were able to use Flip to write small programs to bring about interactive behaviours in the games they created. Furthermore, there was a significant improvement in their computational communication after using Flip (as measured by a pre/post-test). An additional finding was that girls wrote more, and more complex, scripts than did boys, and there was a trend for girls to show greater learning gains relative to the boys.}

The concept of computation can be directly derived from processes characteristic of the Evolution of biology or the evolution of the Universe, rather than presumed from our own mathematical ideas. We advocate the inclusion of meaning in science's deliberations, and support this by insisting that physically embodied abstractions should be considered part concrete in character. Combination of our initial five conceptual entities indicates that biological Evolution follows the same developmental criteria as the evolution of the Universe, albeit with an intermediate change in strategy. We conclude that evolutionarily derived computation is the prime driver of evolution/Evolutions' implications.}

He named it Chaimatics and suggested its generalization to the ultimate all-encompassing theory that unites biology, physics and mathematics. He made a number of experimental discoveries, including color coding in the retina, the participation mechanisms of Ca2+ ions in synaptic transmission, and the measurement of potential in the coupling membranes of mitochondria and chloroplasts. He also made a decisive contribution to the proof of the chemiosmotic hypothesis of oxidative phosphorylation. In a series of works started in 1972, Liberman developed the concept of the molecular computer of the cell, which includes the programs written on DNA and RNA nucleotide sequences and executed by enzymes playing the role of processing units whereas nucleotide sequences are interpreted as commands and addresses. In this framework, Liberman predicted RNA splicing before its discovery and suggested the role of processing of small informational molecules (later defined as small RNAs) in controlling biological processes. Efim Liberman defined the fundamental property of life as a molecular and quantum computational system and introduced the idea of quantum computing inside a cell for making decisions on complex control tasks described by equations of mathematical physics. He approached the brain as a net of molecular computers and created a model of neuron operation based on the transmission of hypersound signals via cytoskeleton where the molecular computational system encodes the digital output. In 1979 Liberman published a hypothesis of human self-consciousness associated with not a chemical, but with a physical quantum coherent system and named it “extremal quantum regulator”. We review here the contributions of Liberman in understanding the mechanisms of intracellular processing of information and his efforts to create an integrative theory of natural computation that aims to unite biology, physics and mathematics.}

However, current formulation development still relies on traditional trial-and-error experiments, which are time-consuming, costly, and unpredictable. With the exponential growth of computing capability and algorithms, in recent ten years, a new discipline named “computational pharmaceutics” integrates with big data, artificial intelligence, and multi-scale modeling techniques into pharmaceutics, which offered great potential to shift the paradigm of drug delivery. Computational pharmaceutics can provide multi-scale lenses to pharmaceutical scientists, revealing physical, chemical, mathematical, and data-driven details ranging across pre-formulation studies, formulation screening, in vivo prediction in the human body, and precision medicine in the clinic. The present paper provides a comprehensive and detailed review in all areas of computational pharmaceutics and “Pharma 4.0”, including artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms, molecular modeling, mathematical modeling, process simulation, and physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling. We not only summarized the theories and progress of these technologies but also discussed the regulatory requirements, current challenges, and future perspectives in the area, such as talent training and a culture change in the future pharmaceutical industry.}

This research introduces a feedback-based computational method conceived as four development cycles to design and evaluate fibre layups of large-scale architectural building components, and a multi-scalar digital-physical design and evaluation toolset to model and evaluate them at multiple resolutions. The universal applicability of the developed methods is showcased by two different architectural fibre structures. The results show how the systematization of methods and toolset allow for increased design flexibility and deeper integration of interdisciplinary collaborators.

In this light,we are proposing a novel online platform for the visualization of epidemiological data incorporating social determinants for understanding the patterns associated with the spread of COVID-19. The current AI computational platform combines modeling methodologies along with temporal geospatial visualization of COVID-19 data, providing real-time sharing of graphic analytical simulation of vulnerable hotspots of recurrent (nowcasting) and emergent (forecasting) infections visualized on a spatiotemporal scale on geoportals. The proposed study will be a secondary data analysis of primary data accessed from the national portal (Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)) incorporating 766 districts in India. Epidemiological data related to spatiotemporal visualization of the demographic spread of COVID-19 will be displayed using a compartmental socio-epidemiological model, reproduction number R, epi-curve diagrams as well as choropleth maps for different levels of administrative and development units at the district levels.}

The two problems that characterize the modern psychology of thinking are mental representation and mental computation. Throughout the history of psychology, there has been an agreement that the essential features of a problem are that an organism has a goal but lacks a clear or well-learned route to the goal. Thus the emphasis in research on problem solving has been on response discovery—how the organism arrives at an effective, goal-attaining behavior. There have often been controversies over the role of learning or past experiences in problem solving. This chapter illustrates the conflict between emphases on learning and emphases on perception as central components of problem solving. Because a problem solver must find a solution, it might seem inevitable that an essential activity tries different approaches makes errors until the right approach is found. Earlier in problem-solving research, trial and error became associated with the view that acquiring a solution was a gradual, undirected process that did not involve perception or comprehension of problem requirements or structure.}

The first step of this case-study research is to determine both the analytical factors of classic tectonics and the digital cases. The next step discusses emergent digital factors of tectonics. The third step applies the four new factors to the tectonic processes of five digital projects by well-known architects who have actual building experience in both predigital and digital works. Some phenomena of digital tectonics have emerged to reveal the dynamic factors of motion, information, generation and fabrication. In a preliminary framework of new tectonics, seven classic and four digital factors form a whole and interact with each other.}

In the realm of enantioselective Diels–Alder reactions, a role of primary importance is held by Mg-BOX catalysis. The main features of both catalysts and ligand in directing the stereoselective outcome have been extensively studied in several papers mainly through 1H NMR and X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques. However, over the years, no computational studies have been reported to support the models proposed to rationalize the observed stereoselectivity for the reaction between 3-acryloyl-1,3-oxazolidin-2-one and cyclopentadiene catalyzed by the BOX ligand (R,R)-(+)-2,2′-isopropylidenebis­(4-phenyl-2-oxazoline) and Mg­(II) salts. To approach the problem, we performed a density functional theory (DFT) computational study, aiming to locate the preferred transitions states deriving from these proposed models, but we only found a correspondence in selectivities for the reaction catalyzed by Mg­(OTf)2, where the model suggests an octahedral complex with the two triflate anions coordinating magnesium. For the other cases [i.e., Mg­(ClO4)2, Mg­(ClO4)2·2H2O, and MgI2·I2], the commonly accepted tetrahedral or octahedral models suggest no involvement of the perchlorate or iodide anions, but the corresponding calculations did not reproduce the experimental selectivities. Only when we considered also in these cases coordination complexes involving their presence, the observed selectivities were reproduced, thus opening new insights to better understand the role and the action of the counterion to determine the stereochemical outcome of these reactions.}

This framework simulates a construction site by orchestrating 3D mobile objects against a 3D background and produces multimodal labels for target entities. The effectiveness of the synthetic data in training object detection models was thoroughly validated. For the construction worker detection task, a YOLOv7 model trained with synthetic data nearly matched the performance of a model trained with real data: it achieved 71% AP@0.5–0.95 compared to 75% for the real data-trained model. Moreover, the model trained with synthetic data surpassed its real data counterpart in scenarios requiring stricter IoU thresholds, particularly above 85%. Acquiring a sufficient quantity and diverse range of imagery data has been a primary challenge in construction studies that focus on automation and digitization through deep neural networks. BlendCon can significantly contribute to addressing this data scarcity challenge.}

Overall, we conclude by stating that there is often a knowledge gap between (clinical) pharmacologists and researchers who exploit (pharmaco)genomics big data by using advanced computing methods. To overcome the limited number of advanced computational, statistical and mathematical methods and protocols, we propose a broad implementation and standardization of NGS techniques that should be explored by the PGx community.}

abstract = {Data-driven urbanism is often entangled with the smart city and practiced in a way that prioritizes control over physical objects and downplays the human and political aspects of data. We label this approach ‘hard city sensing’ (HCS) and we argue that the rise of the ‘digital city’ offers the empirical foundation for more humanistic approaches. Driven by the ambition to untangle data-driven urbanism from HCS, this paper reviews two decades of scholarship that has used digital traces as an empirical ground for understanding urban phenomena. The review identifies four distinct ways of working with digital traces of which three pave the way for new ways of problematizing the city. Instead of abandoning the idea of data-driven urbanism, we propose the framework of 'soft city sensing' (SCS) as way to re-engage with it with inspiration from these pioneering works. However, this requires a willingness to revisit central epistemological commitments that currently serve as standards for how to “properly” do data projects. We therefore urge qualitative urban scholars to ponder the possibilities of furthering their urban interest by ‘thinking with algorithms’ while retaining their interpretative ambitions just as we identify a need for urban decion-makers to expand their criteria for what serves as valid data inputs to urban planning.}

abstract = {Total knee replacement (TKR) surgery is done on individuals with end-stage osteoarthritis to restore knee function and alleviate joint discomfort. There have been recent developments in the design of customized implants based on patient-specific data obtained from MRI scans and subsequent image processing techniques. Here curvature of the femoral component plays an important role in effective implant design. Therefore, the objective here is to investigate the influence of this curvature of the femoral component on the mechanical response of the bearing component. A 3D finite element knee implant model with a circular and an elliptical femoral component is developed and investigated for gait kinetics and kinematics. Responses such as contact pressure, stresses, strains, and wear produced on the tibial insert are estimated throughout the gait cycle. These findings suggest that the elliptical femoral component generates less contact pressure on the tibial insert than its circular counterpart. It is also inferred that too much variation in this curvature is not recommended as it may affect the patient's comfort level. In addition, the wear of the tibial insert is computed based on the contact pressure created by both knee implant models. Our study suggests an optimum value for the curvature and the comfort level of the patients over the existing knee implant designs.}

Challenges that currently exist between computational biology and biological computation were outlined and further discussed for a solution to fill the persistent “wet dry” research gap for a better future. Emerging proper techniques for combining data from several modalities is the foremost challenge in handling single-cell multimodal data. This process has been referred to as “data integration” It includes various strategies, from batch-correcting individual omics datasets to correlating chromatin accessibility to development in virtually all genetic mutations with transcription. In this chapter, we offer solutions for how researchers can overcome challenges to inspire the creation of various computer science algorithms and approaches, as well as how computational methods and mathematical modeling have aided in the comprehension of different biological domains, including computational and stem cell biology. A few current references and examples have been incorporated to explain the emerging concepts in computational biology and address existing problems. They are discussed here with their future aspects, hoping to encourage younger researchers to work in this fascinating field and deal with the challenges mentioned before with a modern approach.}

Therefore, it is crucial to understand what makes research managerially relevant and to uncover success factors in the genesis of such research. This study addresses these issues through a qualitative analysis of 65 depth interviews with senior editors of business transfer journals, marketing managers, and academic researchers. The authors carve out distinct, multidimensional properties that determine managerial relevance. From specific configurations of these properties, four archetypical relevance types emerge: (1) problem-solving, (2) explicating, (3) consolidating, and (4) forward-thinking relevance. Finally, the authors develop a unifying framework and identify success factors for generating highly relevant research. Based on these insights, they suggest concrete courses of action for academics who seek to increase the managerial relevance of their research.}

The research progresses through several phases: identifying research problems, collecting baseline data on decision-making, implementing AI interventions, and evaluating the outcomes post-intervention to identify shifts in performance. The results demonstrate that GAI effectively reduces human cognitive burdens and mitigates heuristic biases by offering data-driven support and predictive analytics, grounded in System 2 reasoning. This is particularly valuable in complex situations characterized by unfamiliarity and information overload, where intuitive, System 1 thinking is less effective. However, the study also uncovers challenges related to GAI integration, such as potential over-reliance on technology, intrinsic biases particularly ‘out-of-the-box’ thinking without contextual creativity. To address these issues, this paper proposes an innovative strategic framework for HI-GAI collaboration that emphasizes transparency, accountability, and inclusiveness.}

This chapter is an attempt to clear the names of artificial intelligence (AI) and computational cognitive science. These two related disciplines have been accused of a conceptual error so profound that their very existence is jeopardized. Sometimes, however, philosophers successfully arrest and lock up the guilty. The best example of this, ironically, is in psychology. Artificial intelligence and computational cognitive science are both committed to the claim that computers can think. The former is committed to the claim that human-made computers can think, while computational cognitive science is committed to the view that naturally occurring computers, brains, think. AI is the field dedicated to building intelligent computers. AI ultimately wants a machine that could solve very difficult, novel problems like proving Fermat's last theorem, correcting the greenhouse effect, or figuring out the fundamental structure of space-time. Historically, AI is associated with computer science, but the compleat AI researcher frequently knows a fair amount of psychology, linguistics, neuroscience, mathematics, and possibly some other discipline.}

We begin with a topic modelling analysis generating ten major themes (topics) leading to an overview of how research areas are connected to the meaning of rural context. Turning to the Nordic region, as an in-depth example, we illustrate the complexity of rural digital geographies, through a qualitative content analysis. This demonstrates that digital in rural contexts are primarily positioned outwardly as social/regional development and business/economy, and less situated inwardly through individual experience and community building. Combined we show a wide spectrum of rural-digital relations but demonstrate that rural contexts in rural-digital relations need more attention. We propose three propositions to invite deeper rural contextualizations in future digital studies to uphold the importance of rural spaces and places through, by and with digital geography.}

abstract = {This paper considers the social representation of an incinerator plant operating for more than 30 years in a medium-sized city in Italy. A survey was carried out with a representative sample of an Italian town, a community that was not generally hostile to it. On the basis of self-efficacy and trust in institutions, and by applying cluster analyses, we obtain evidence for four distinct groups labelled as Fatalists, Collaboratives, Activists, and Delegants. The four groups express systematic variations in social representation. We discuss the theoretical and practical impacts of these results.}

abstract = {At Australian Catholic University and Monash University, preservice mathematics teachers are required to conduct and analyse one-to-one mathematics assessment interviews with primary-aged children. The assessment tool is drawn from the Early Numeracy Research Project, where it was used with over 11,000 children in Victorian schools. The interview assesses content from Number, Measurement and Geometry, in an interactive, hands-on format, with children's responses and strategies determining the path through the interview protocol. Follow-up discussion in class enabled preservice teachers to explore appropriate pedagogies that build upon what had been learned from the interviews. The research described in this chapter sought to investigate the effectiveness of this process. Interviews and written questionnaires were the data sources. Analysis of the data suggested that teachers were more aware of the kinds of strategies that children use including their variety and relative level of sophistication, and that the interview and subsequent discussion stimulated preservice teachers to reflect upon appropriate classroom experiences for young mathematics learners.}

abstract = {While games of chance have been played for thousands of years, and while experienced players often had good intuitive ideas of the relative frequencies of various outcomes, the concept of probability as referring to the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes of a ‘fair’ gambling device emerged only 500 or so years ago in Western societies. That allowed evaluation of new games not yet played and later led to a more abstract conception of probability as a measure satisfying certain conditions (‘axioms’). Only in the past 150 years or so has probability had a major role in science and only in the last 50 years or so in everyday life—as for example in evaluating medical outcomes or technological risks or manufacturer liability. Thus, especially in attempting to assess probability in everyday situations, our intuitions are often deficient—more so than those concerning quantity, space, and time. The major problem is not, however, one of making random errors in probability judgments but of making systematic ones that result from a number of well-known and research systematic cognitive biases and heuristics, which are described in this article. These systematic departures from rational assessment do not imply that coherent and accurate probabilistic thinking is (anywhere near) impossible, but that when departures from coherence and accuracy occur, they tend to follow a predictable pattern.}

abstract = {The novelty of the study is in the use of quantum computing analysis of acenaphthopyrazine derivatives using Density Functional Theory (DFT) with the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) basis set. The research focused on intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) and its influence on non-linear optical (NLO) properties. The NLO analysis revealed that the protonated forms of these compounds exhibit higher dipole moments, indicating their potential for NLO applications. Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) analysis identified molecule 5 as having the highest E(2) value of 509.41 kcal/mol, signifying strong electron donation from nitrogen to hydrogen atoms. The study also evaluated the thermal properties, showing that the Gibbs free energy remained positive across a wide temperature range, suggesting that none of the compounds are spontaneously formed in either neutral or protonated states. Additionally, Monte Carlo simulations indicated favorable adsorption energies for these derivatives on the Fe (110) surface, with compound 5 demonstrating the most significant inhibitory potential. We conduced of that, lower negative adsorption energy (−216.729) compound 1 are confirm with highest energy gap (3.396 eV), and smaller refractive index, and electrical conductivityof compound 1 indicates a small metal-inhibitor molecule interaction, as well as are agreement with Monte Carlo simulation for adsorption on Fe (110) non protonated case.}
