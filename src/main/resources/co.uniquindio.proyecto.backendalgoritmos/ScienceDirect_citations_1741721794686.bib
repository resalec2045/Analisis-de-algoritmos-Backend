abstract = {Background
Effective shared decision-making between patients and physicians is crucial for enhancing health care quality and reducing medical errors. The literature shows that the absence of effective methods to facilitate shared decision-making can result in poor patient engagement and unfavorable decision outcomes.
Objective
In this paper, we propose a Collaborative Decision Description Language (CoDeL) to model shared decision-making between patients and physicians, offering a theoretical foundation for studying various shared decision scenarios.
Methods
CoDeL is based on an extension of the interaction protocol language of Lightweight Social Calculus. The language utilizes speech acts to represent the attitudes of shared decision-makers toward decision propositions, as well as their semantic relationships within dialogues. It supports interactive argumentation among decision makers by embedding clinical evidence into each segment of decision protocols. Furthermore, CoDeL enables personalized decision-making, allowing for the demonstration of characteristics such as persistence, critical thinking, and openness.
Results
The feasibility of the approach is demonstrated through a case study of shared decision-making in the disease domain of atrial fibrillation. Our experimental results show that integrating the proposed language with GPT can further enhance its capabilities in interactive decision-making, improving interpretability.
Conclusions
The proposed novel CoDeL can enhance doctor-patient shared decision-making in a rational, personalized, and interpretable manner.}

abstract = {This paper proposes a big data integrated framework to assist with prevention and control of HIV/AIDS, TB and silicosis (HATS) in the mining industry. The linkage between HATS presents a major challenge to the mining industry globally. When the immune system is compromised by HIV/AIDS and silicosis, it makes it easier for tuberculosis to infect the body. In addition, the silica dust which affects the lungs may also cause silicosis and tuberculosis. The objective of this paper is to posit a big data integrated framework to assist in the prevention and control of HATS in the mining industry. Literature was reviewed in order to build a conceptual framework. Although this study is not the first to apply big data in healthcare, to the researcher's knowledge, it is the first to apply big data in understanding the linkage between HATS in the mining industry. The literature review indicates only a few studies using big data in healthcare with no research found on big data and HATS. It therefore makes a contribution to existing body of literature on the control of HATS. The proposed big data framework has the potential of addressing the needs of predictive epidemiology which is important in forecasting and disease control in the mining industry. The paper therefore lays a foundation for the use of viable systems model and big data to address the challenges of HATS in the mining industry. As part of future work, the framework will be validated using sequential explanatory mixed methods case study approach in mining organizations.}

Despite this growing interest, research specifically addressing the Thai context has remained scarce. Thus, this quantitative study aimed to bridge this gap by assessing the proficiency of Thai Gen Z accountants in detecting accounting fraud, with a particular emphasis on their digital, data science, and diagnostic skills. The study collected data from 150 participants using a structured survey questionnaire distributed to licensed accountants affiliated with the Thailand accounting program. It adopted a theoretical framework inspired by social learning theory and information processing theory to examine both direct and mediated relationships among the key variables under investigation. The results were analyzed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) to examine these relationships. The results showed that digital competency have significant direct effects on the fraud detection skills, with diagnostic skills playing a key role in the process. The study revealed that digital competency not only furnishes accountants with necessary technological expertise but also bolsters their analytical skills, which are vital for identifying fraudulent activities. Likewise, data science literacy—encompassing skills in predictive analytics, big data management, and data insight communication—significantly enhances accountants' capacity to identify and understand fraudulent patterns. The emergent role of diagnostic skills as a key intermediary emphasizes the importance of comprehensive training programs that foster both technical prowess and critical analytical thinking.}

This chapter discusses the characteristics of nonverbal thinking in man and elementary reasoning activity in animals and children. Verbal thinking is associated with the formation of a structural–functional organization of a pattern-code of verbal signals. Nonverbal thinking is associated with comprehension of the principles that make up the structural organization of environment. This type of thinking occurs in humans and other vertebrates. The chapter also discusses physiological and phenotypic aspects of nonverbal thinking. Both types of thinking have their own characteristics, which are related to the chemistry of the brain, and both reflect the nature of man. The main characteristic of nonverbal thinking is the success in performing the task at the first attempt. Repeated presentations of the task often lead to refusals to resolve it, the appearance of fear of the experimental conditions, and numerous signs of an overexcited state. A study described in the chapter revealed age to be a leading factor in determining the accurate understanding of object movement within the spatial–temporal coordinate system when the exact whereabouts of the object is unknown.}

However, this property of multiplication is difficult for students to understand. We used two unique data sets to explore middle school students’ use of the distributive property. Study 1 involved data from 1:1 structured interviews of students (N = 24) discussing worked examples and solving associated practice problems. We examined whether or not students used the distributive property to solve the problems and whether or not interviewers followed the recommended distributive property prompts or defaulted to more conventional methods. Despite exposure to worked examples using the distributive property and a protocol calling for attention to it, students and interviewers favored methods like PEMDAS (parentheses, exponents, multiplication, division, addition, subtraction) or long multiplication. Study 2 used a data set with middle school students’ (N = 131) item-level responses on Kirkland’s (2022; doctoral dissertation, University of Notre Dame) Brief Assessment of Mature Number Sense along with several related measures of domain-general and domain-specific skills. We extracted problems involving the distributive property for analysis. Surprisingly, there was no evidence that students’ use of the distributive property improved from sixth grade to eighth grade. However, both grade-level mathematics achievement and cognitive reflection uniquely predicted the correct use of the distributive property. Results suggest that middle school students who exhibit stronger reflective thinking tend to perform better on distributive property problems. Findings highlight cognitive reflection as a potentially important construct involved in the understanding and use of the distributive property.}

abstract = {The brain is first and foremost a control system that is capable of building an internal representation of the external world, and using this representation to make decisions, set goals and priorities, formulate plans, and control behavior with intent to achieve its goals. The internal representation is distributed throughout the brain in two forms: (1) firmware embedded in synaptic connections and axon-dendrite circuitry, and (2) dynamic state-variables encoded in the firing rates of neurons in computational loops in the spinal cord, midbrain, subcortical nuclei, and arrays of cortical columns. It assumes that clusters and arrays of neurons are capable of computing logical predicates, smooth arithmetic functions, and matrix transformations over a space defined by large input vectors and arrays. Feedback from output to input of these neural computational units enable them to function as finite-state-automata (fsa), Markov decision processes (MDP), or delay lines in processing signals and generating strings and grammars. Thus, clusters of neurons are capable of parsing and generating language, decomposing tasks, generating plans, and executing scripts. In the cortex, neurons are arranged in arrays of cortical columns that interact in tight loops with their underlying subcortical nuclei. It is hypothesized that these circuits compute sophisticated mathematical and logical functions that maintain and use complex abstract data structures. It is proposed that cortical hypercolumns together with their underlying thalamic nuclei can be modeled as a cortical computational unit (CCU) consisting of a frame-like data structure (containing attributes and pointers) plus the computational processes and mechanisms required to maintain it and use it for perception cognition, and sensory-motor behavior. In sensory processing areas of the brain, CCU processes enable focus of attention, segmentation, grouping, and classification. Pointers stored in CCU frames define relationships that link pixels and signals to objects and events in situations and episodes. CCU frame pointers also link objects and events to class prototypes and overlay them with meaning and emotional values. In behavior generating areas of the brain, CCU processes make decisions, set goals and priorities, generate plans, and control behavior. In general, CCU pointers are used to define rules, grammars, procedures, plans, and behaviors. CCU pointers also define abstract data structures analogous to lists, frames, objects, classes, rules, plans, and semantic nets. It is suggested that it may be possible to reverse engineer the human brain at the CCU level of fidelity using next-generation massively parallel computer hardware and software.}

This chapter provides a chronological account of the steps which describes the present theoretical framework for thinking about depiction. The experimental results provides good evidence for the following assertions: (1) knowledge is a necessary part of all acts of depiction done by people of all ages and of all levels of skill, (2) knowledge is a main determinant of looking strategies, (3) the role of knowledge in the organization of looking strategies is one of determining the level of description to be used as the basis of analytic processes, and (4) "good" copying performance (i.e., "accurate" in terms of scene-specific and view-specific relations) can be equated with level of description accessed. The chapter emphasizes on: (1) each descending level of description implies an increasing disintegration of the analytic task. (2) Analysis for depiction is concerned with variance. It is concerned with relations that change according to viewing circumstances. In effect, they can be considered as novel relations. There is much evidence that people's ability to maintain "novel" relations in memory is severely limited. (3) The model consisting of a group of straight lines is only capable of being analyzed at the lowest levels of description.}

Photos do not need to be false (altered or generated) to mislead; real photos can create a slanted representation or be repurposed from different events. Even semantically related non-probative photos, merely inserted to attract eyeballs, can increase message acceptance through increased fluency. Messages with images receive more attention and reach a wider audience. Text-congruent images can scaffold the comprehension of true and false claims and support the formation of correct and false memories. Standard laboratory procedures may underestimate the impact of images in natural media contexts: by drawing all participants' attention to a message that may be ignored without an image, they inflate message effects in the control condition. Misleading images are difficult to identify and their influence often remains outside of awareness, making it hard to curb their influence through critical-thinking interventions. Current concerns about deep fakes may reduce trust in all images, potentially limiting their power to mislead as well as inform. More research is needed to understand how knowing that an image is misleading influences inferences, impressions, and judgments beyond immediate assessments of the image's credibility.}

While being true that digitalization has entered schools, it often follows a basic and simple process of digital replication of approaches and materials that were previously only available on physical media. This work focuses on the use of Extended Realities, more precisely, Mixed Reality, for teaching Mathematics, and very particularly in the teaching of Geometry, through the proposition of a conceptual model that combines the use of Extended Reality and Machine Learning. The proposed model was subject to prototyping, which is presented as a form of laboratory validation as a contribution to innovate the way of how the geometry teaching-learning process is developed and to promote the integration of Extended Reality technologies into the Education Sector as practical tools, as well due to its potential use to obtain useful insights for teachers, and students, throughout the process.}

We trace the possible relations between his proto-connectionist notion of ‘organising’ machines in Turing (1948) on the one hand and his mathematical theory of morphogenesis in developmental biology (1952) on the other. These works were concerned with distinct fields of inquiry and followed distinct paradigms of biological theory, respectively postulating analogues of Darwinian selection in learning and mathematical laws of form in organic pattern formation. Still, these strands of Turing’s work are related, first, in terms of being amenable in principle to his (1936) computational method of modelling. Second, they are connected by Turing’s scattered speculations about the possible bearing of learning processes on the anatomy of the brain. We argue that these two theories form an unequal couple that, from different angles and in partial fashion, point towards cognition as a biological and embodied phenomenon while, for reasons inherent to Turing’s computational approach to modelling, not being capable of directly addressing it as such. We explore ways in which these two distinct-but-related theories could be more explicitly and systematically connected, using von Neumann’s contemporaneous and related work on Cellular Automata and more recent biomimetic approaches as a foil. We conclude that the nature of ‘initiative’ and the mode of material realisation are the key issues that decide on the possibility of intelligent machinery in Turing.}

Later we review the basic neural mechanisms associated with creating meaning in both approaches: lateral inhibition and the creation of cortical maps by resonance to patterns of stimuli of families of spatially ordered neurons. We end by considering the usefulness in artificial intelligence of knowledge about the way in which biological systems construct their representation spaces. We stress the idea regarding events as representation entities and, consequently, using an event time, different from physical time. Semantics emerges from the mechanisms that detect these relevant events in each organisational level and their composition rules to specify the constitutive entities of the next level. This semantic is distributed in the cortical maps of the neuron groups that resound to the corresponding events.}

abstract = {Increasingly, decision makers seek to harness “big data” to guide choices in management and policy settings as well as in professions that manufacture, build, and innovate. Scholars examining this trend tend to diagnose it at once as techno positivist in its insistence on design yoked to quantifiable variables and computational modeling and, alternatively, as an imperative integral to realizing ecologically sustainable innovation. This article investigates this tension. It reflects on the role of futurists, designers, architects, urban planners, social scientists, and artists in interpreting and utilizing comprehensiveness as a design frame. Among nine experimental foresight workshops at the inaugural Emerge conference at Arizona State University, many focused on producing physical objects or media, one modeled and expanded upon a method pioneered by architect and polymath R. Buckminster Fuller. At a time when many of the capabilities to realize Fuller's specifications for big data have matured, I investigate whether comprehensive design as framed by Fuller's method shows promise as a trend enabling ecologically sustainable innovations. A historical look at Fuller's Design Science and the reflection on it in the Emerge workshop marks an opportunity to highlight and interpret the resurgence of comprehensive thinking in design while navigating the contradictions this orientation engenders.}

To investigate graduating nursing students' nursing and professional competencies and the predictors of their competencies.
Background
Across Asian countries, there is a paucity of literature that explores graduating nursing students' competency and professional competence during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
Design
Descriptive, cross-sectional, and predictive approaches.
Method
Convenience sampling was used among graduating nursing students from the six Asian countries (n = 375). The STROBE guidelines for cross-sectional studies were used. Two self-report instruments were utilized to collect data. We conducted multiple linear regression analyses to assess the predictors of nursing competency and professional competence domains.
Results
Country of residence and general point average (GPA) showed statistically significant multivariate effects. Value-based nursing care and critical thinking and reasoning domains recorded the highest in professional competence and competency inventory for nursing students, respectively. Country of residence, GPA, and preferred nursing major were significant predictors of graduating nursing students' nursing competency and professional competence domains.
Conclusion
Our study's findings revealed a high level of diversity among nursing students regarding ethical care obligations, caring pedagogies, and lifelong learning, all of which may be ascribed to their distinct culture, background, and belief systems.}

abstract = {The Transient Reactor Analysis Code (TRAC), which features a two-fluid treatment of thermal-hydraulics, is designed to model transients in water reactors and related facilities. One of the major computational costs associated with TRAC and similar codes is calculating constitutive coefficients. Although the formulations for these coefficients are local, the costs are flow-regime- or data-dependent; i.e., the computations needed for a given spatial node often vary widely as a function of time. Consequently, a fixed, uniform assignment of nodes to parallel processors will result in degraded computational efficiency due to the poor load balancing. A standard method for treating data-dependent models on vector architectures has been to use gather operations (or indirect addressing) to sort the nodes into subsets that (temporarily) share a common computational model. However, this method is not effective on distributed memory data parallel architectures, where indirect addressing involves expensive communication overhead. Another serious problem with this method involves software engineering challenges in the areas of maintainability and extensibility. For example, an implementation that was hand-tuned to achieve good computational efficiency would have to be rewritten whenever the decision tree governing the sorting was modified. Using an example based on the calculation of the wall-to-liquid and wall-to-vapor heat-transfer coefficients for three nonboiling flow regimes, we describe how the use of the Fortran 90 WHERE construct and automatic inlining of functions can be used to ameliorate this problem while improving both efficiency and software engineering. Unfortunately, a general automatic solution to the load-balancing problem associated with data-dependent computations is not yet available for massively parallel architectures. We discuss why developers should either wait for such solutions or consider alternative numerical algorithms, such as a neural network representation, that do not exhibit load-balancing problems.}

While various approaches, such as energy systems analysis and linear or non-linear optimisation, have been employed to achieve energy sustainability mainly at the national or city level, there has been a lack of focus on achieving energy sustainability in the residential sector through a holistic optimal decision-making approach for efficient HES design. This study focuses on developing a multi-stage optimisation-based decision-making framework that models, quantifies, and optimises the performance indicators of HES, allowing for an assessment of the trade-off between benefits and systems costs under various design scenarios. The initial step involves designing the HES model and constructing scenarios that cater to the electrification requirements of water, energy, and food elements in the residential sector by using a systematic thinking approach. Then, a preliminary evaluation of the modelled scenarios is conducted to assess energy sustainability in terms of technical and economic aspects. Afterwards, an optimal decision-making setup is established by integrating a multi-objective HES model into the NSGA-II algorithm, which approximates the Pareto optimal solutions. These solutions are then ranked by using a multi-criteria decision-making method. According to the findings, the Quetta region in Pakistan contains the best optimal solution. The results underscore the utility of the developed framework in facilitating the optimal design of renewables-integrated HES for the residential sector. Furthermore, intergovernmental organizations can leverage this framework to formulate effective policies aimed at encouraging residents to invest in HES installation.}

abstract = {We consider a class of Kuramoto models, with an array of N individual k-dimensional clocks (k>1), coupled within a directed, range dependent, network. For each directed connection, a signal triggered at the sending clock incurs a (real valued) time delay before arriving at the receiving clock, where it induces an instantaneous phase reset affecting all k-phases. Instantaneous phase resetting maps (PRMs) for k-dimensional clocks have received little attention. The system may be treated as open and subject to periodic, or other types of, PRM forcing at any individual clock, as a result of external forcing stimuli. We show how the full system, with Nk phase variables, responds to such stimuli, as the impact spreads across the entire network. Beyond simulations, we employ methods to reverse engineer the dynamical behaviour of the whole: estimating the intrinsic dimensions of the responses to different experiments; and by analysing pairwise comparisons between those responses. This shows that the system’s responses are governed by a hierarchy of internal dynamical modes, existing across both the Nk phases and over time. We argue that this Kuramoto system is a model for the human cortex, where each k-dimensional clock models the dynamics of a single neural column, which contains 10,000 densely inter-connected neurons. The Kuramoto model exploits the natural network of networks architecture of the human cortex. An array of N=1M such columns/clocks is at the 10B neuron scale of the human cortex. However its simulation is far more accessible than very large scale (VLS) simulations of neuron-to-neuron systems on supercomputers. The latent modes may have important implications for cognition (information processing) and for consciousness (the existence of internal phenomenological experiences). We argue that the existence of the latter plays a key role in preconditioning the former, reducing the decision sets and the cognitive load, and thus enabling a fast-thinking evolutionary advantage. This is the first time that systems of k-dimensional clocks (k> 1), coupled via time-lagged PRMs, within range dependent networks, have been deployed to demonstrate the basic internal phenomenological elements (of consciousness) and their potential role within immediate cognition. Statement of Significance: We argue that this Kuramoto system is a model for the human cortex, where each of 1M k-dimensional clocks models the dynamics of a single neural column (containing 10,000 densely inter-connected neurons). This Kuramoto model exploits the natural network of networks architecture of the human cortex. Large scale human cortex simulations, with 10B neutrons, usually require a super computer. We show that similar results, using this model, can be obtained on a laptop. In particular we show that such dynamical can support internal phenomenological elements (of conscious experience) and we discuss their potential role in preconditioning immediate cognition, furnishing a “fast thinking” evolutionary advantage to the human brain.}

Thus because of the consistent running enormous measure of heat is produced. At the point when this heat isn't appropriately disseminated, the engine gets more fragile very soon and life of the engine declines because of the heat development. To build the life of the engine, heat dispersal is expanded by giving fins at external of engine chamber. The shape of the fins and the material used for the fin increases its heat dissipation capacity and in turn increases the cooling of the engine for proper functioning. The present work focuses on the design of fins of circular and tapered shapes for a 2-stroke engine. The temperature distribution and the heat dissipation along the fin surface of two shapes has been observed by a steady state thermal analysis. Alusil and Silumin has been selected as the fin materials and a computational evaluation has also been done using FEM. A better shape of the fin along with a suitable material has been selected based on the results observed by FEM and on comparison with the existing shape and material of the fin.}

For some parameter values, sophisticated predators are able to reason their way to the Nash equilibrium strategy, and prices do not oscillate. As parameter values are perturbed, the system undergoes a bifurcation and predators select strategies from a mean-preserving spread of the Nash equilibrium strategy. In these settings, prices display excess volatility and a single shock can send predators into an oscillatory trading frenzy.}

The twin transition suggests that, to maximize the impact of sustainable solutions, humans and (disruptive) technologies need to be effectively integrated. Methods to conceptually build such (eco)systems integrating these and assess their ecological impact before implementation are lacking. This paper addresses this gap by proposing the Circulise framework, a model-driven method designed to build circular systems and evaluate their environmental performance. The approach promotes design-thinking to create socio-technical ecosystems that can be evaluated at the light of their alignment with circular economy and/or sustainability principles and be used to generate operational software behavior. The Circulise framework was developed following the methodological guidance of design science research. It is applied in this paper to the case of Fanyatu, a non-profit organization focused on reforestation in the Congo Basin, showing its ability to create a circular ecosystem not only supporting the creation of regenerative CO2-absorbing forests but also empowering and improving the quality of life of the local communities involved in the planting of trees. In Fanyatu’s case, Circulise’s strategic planning and technology integration lead to virtuous cycles, enabling a snowball effect in forest creation and the promotion of sustainable projects. The framework’s scalability and versatility allow it to be applied across various contexts, enabling the creation of customized circular ecosystems for sustainability tailored to specific human and technological needs.}

However, in this paper, we, somewhat whimsically, explore some ideas about what a material’s gene could be and how it could be used to further our understanding of materials structure and properties. The result is a slightly non-conventional, less crystal-centric, view of materials structure that we believe can, will, and is resulting in novel materials insights.}

(i) Correlation: a neural representation correlates to its represented content; (ii) causal role: the representation has a characteristic effect on behavior; and (iii) teleology: a goal or purpose served by the behavior and thus the representation. We draw broadly on literature in both neuroscience and philosophy to show how these three aspects are rooted in common approaches to understanding the brain and mind. We first describe different contexts that ‘representation’ has been closely linked to in neuroscience, then discuss each of the three aspects in detail.}

In this chapter, we present a novel way of using evolutionary computation techniques to evolve artificial neural networks (ANNs) first to perceive size and then to count, and compare their counting skills to a different group of ANNs who evolved to count from scratch. The results revealed better counting skills when evolving first to perceive size (or other classification task) and then to count over those who evolved just to count. In addition, ANNs who evolved with continuous stimuli presented better counting skills than those evolved with discrete stimuli.}

Policy and public discourse around digitalisation embrace and adhere to the narrow tenets enlightenment thinking; the idea that rationality, individual freedom, and a society free from superstition are necessary and attainable goals. The costs of what has come to be called ‘Modernity’ are many. Through the application of rationality to all spheres of life, married with disruptive technological advancement, humanity has diminished its’ imagination – its ability to seek new directions. To paraphrase Horkheimer and Adorno, Modernism fights against nature, of which we are a part, and thus, paradoxically, sets us in a fight against ourselves. Environmental degradation, the price of progress, being just one example of this – deadening work, consumerism and severed social connections being amongst others. In this framing, digitalisation itself comes to be understood itself as akin to a force of nature – one that we can do little about, other than adjust and adapt or be swept away. But this by no means a foregone conclusion, there is light at the end of the optical fibre. Albeit that recent technical developments around artificial intelligence appears to be pushing policy makers into hasty decisions, the pace of the technical development is not as fast as we believe, and in comparison with the Reformation – we have time. If we can restrain ourselves from the resist, adapt or die responses promoted in popular discourse in face of the shock of large language models and rising threat of automation, then we create room to consider economic, social, and ecological alignment and accord, in the decision making and design of future interactive artefacts and digital services. The article argues that through postdigital aesthetics, technology makers can embrace materiality and the inherent qualities of digital technology to formulate a critique of existing trajectories in digital transformation, with consequences for a more sustainable future.}

abstract = {A finite element method for computational fluid dynamics has been implemented on the Connection Machine systems CM-2 and CM-200. An implicit iterative solution strategy, based on the preconditioned matrix-free GMRES algorithm, is employed. Parallel data structures built on both nodal and elemental sets are used to achieve maximum parallelization. Communication primitives provided through the Connection Machine Scientific Software Library substantially improved the overall performance of the program. Computations of three-dimensional compressible flows using unstructured meshes having close to one million elements, such as a complete airplane, demonstrate that the Connection Machine systems are suitable for these applications. Performance comparisons are also carried out with the vector computers Cray Y-MP and Convex C-1.}

Although there is a plethora of well documented cases on strategic and operational interventions of cyber commands, the cyber tactical military edge is still a challenge, where cyber fires barely integrate to the traditional joint targeting cycle due to, among others, long planning/development times, asymmetric effects, strict target reachability requirements, or the fast propagation of collateral damage; the latter rapidly deriving on hybrid impacts (political, economic, social, etc.) and evidencing significant socio-technical gaps. In this context, it is expected that Tactical Clouds disruptively facilitate cyber operations at the edge while exposing the rest of the digital assets of the operation to them. On these grounds, the main purpose of the conducted research is to review and in depth analyze the risks and opportunities of jeopardizing the sustainability of the military Tactical Clouds at their cyber edge. Along with a 1) comprehensively formulation of the researched problematic, the study 2) formalizes the Tactical Denial of Sustainability (TDoS) concept; 3) introduces the phasing, potential attack surfaces, terrains and impact of TDoS attacks; 4) emphasizes the related human and socio-technical aspects; 5) analyzes the threats/opportunities inherent to their impact on the cloud energy efficiency; 6) reviews their implications at the military cyber thinking for tactical operations; 7) illustrates five extensive CONOPS that facilitate the understanding of the TDoS concept; and given the high novelty of the discussed topics, this paper 8) paves the way for further research and development actions.}

However, this approach fails to give a comprehensive account of each inputs' relevance, since simultaneous perturbations in two or more parameters often entail higher-order effects that cannot be captured by an OAT analysis. We propose to conduct global variance-based sensitivity analysis instead, whereby n parameters are viewed as uncertain at once and their importance is assessed jointly. Our method works by encoding the uncertainties as n additional variables of the network. To prevent the curse of dimensionality while adding these dimensions, we use low-rank tensor decomposition to break down the new potentials into smaller factors. Last, we apply the method of Sobol to the resulting network to obtain n global sensitivity indices, one for each parameter of interest. Using a benchmark array of both expert-elicited and learned Bayesian networks, we demonstrate that the Sobol indices can significantly differ from the OAT indices, thus revealing the true influence of uncertain parameters and their interactions.}

Firstly, a time field change criterion is established based on the variation of phase field variable and its increment, so that the pseudo time increment and load increment can be adaptively regulated with the solution of displacement and phase fields, which cuts down on computation time and the number of iterations. Secondly, the implementation of the scheme is introduced. Finally, the effectiveness of proposed solution scheme is tested through some numerical examples. The results showcase that the proposed strategy can not only acquire accurate load–displacement responses and crack patterns, but also significantly reduce the computational cost. By comparing with the current standard staggered strategy and the monolithic BFGS strategy, the computation time of the presented solution scheme is about 1% of that of the standard strategy, and less than 1/3 of the time of the BFGS strategy. Meanwhile, the presented scheme also exhibits excellent convergence properties.}

The TNM system of staging cancers is a simple and effective method to map the extent of tumours. It had traditionally strived to maintain a balance between being simple and user-friendly on one hand and comprehensive on the other. A number of revisions have taken place over the years with the goal of improving utility. However, numerous controversies surround the TNM system. There is a school of thought that contends that patient co-morbidity and specific tumour-related factors should be incorporated to add further prognostic capabilities in the TNM system, but this raises concerns that such an approach may unnecessarily complicate the system. This review highlights some controversies that surround the TNM system and suggests prognostic indicators that may be added to make it more useful in guiding treatment decisions and predicting outcomes.}

We discuss behavioral and neuronal findings from three areas that reflect strong connections between ASC and the underlying effects on metacontrol on the one hand and components of creativity on the other hand: drug-induced ASC, meditation-induced ASC, and hallucinations. While more, and especially more systematic research is needed, we identify a general trend, suggesting that factors that induce ASC are likely to alter the metacontrol state by biasing it toward either persistence, which is beneficial for convergent thinking and other persistence-heavy operations, or flexibility, which is beneficial for divergent thinking and other flexibility-heavy operations.}

Special emphasis is put on the optimal sequencing of divergent and convergent behavior by showing that divergence must be inhibited at one point to converge toward creative behavior so that excessive divergence is counterproductive. We test this hypothesis with a behavioral experiment, using measures of individual divergence and convergence components of creative potential in high school students. Results confirmed that a mix of divergence and convergence predicted high performance in a bandit task but not in a purely random task or in a simple repetitive task. These predictions are maintained after controlling for sex, personality, incentives, and other factors. As hypothesized, creative cognition was necessary for high performance under the appropriate conditions. However, it was not necessary to get high grades in a traditional school system.
Educational relevance statement
Relating to the goal of educators and public policies in the 21st century to make children and adolescents more creative, and schools more receptive to creative thinking, this research focuses on the creative potential and behavior of high school students. It provides an evidence-based policy argument in support of the screening and development by the educational sector of the creative potential of students.}

It thinks big, and is chiefly imagined in terms of large-scale information communications systems that hinge on the collection of real-time and so-called ‘big data’. Less talked about are the human-scale implications and user-experience of the smart city. Much of the current academic scholarship on smart cities offers synoptic and technical perspectives, leaving the users of smart systems curiously unaccounted for. While they purport to empower citizens, smart cities initiatives are rarely focused at the citizen-scale, nor do they necessarily attend to the ways initiatives can be user-led or co-designed. Drawing on the outcomes of a university studio, this article rethinks the smart city as a series of urban scales—metropolis, community, individual, and personal—and proposes an analytical model for classifying smart city initiatives in terms of engagement. Informed by the theory of proxemics, the model proposed analyses smart city initiatives in terms of the scope of their features and audience size; the actors accountable for their deployment and maintenance; their spatial reach; and the ability of design solutions to re-shape and adapt to different urban scenarios and precincts. We argue that the significance of this model lies in its potential to facilitate modes of thinking across and between scales in ways that can gauge the levels of involvement in the design of digitally mediated urban environments, and productively re-situate citizens as central to the design of smart city initiatives.}

Forests have historically not been perceived as interconnected networks of trees; recently however, researchers have described the “wood-wide web” in which underground fungi interconnect large numbers of trees and plants via chemical and electrical signals. Some of earth’s forests number many billions of trees, and some of the world’s prairies and seagrass meadows also contain billions of individual plants. These plant ecosystems may thus be self-aware, and in fact there may be a multitude of self-aware plant-based ecosystems on earth already. The speed of signal transmission via fungi within each ecosystem is much slower than that in humans, and therefore their organismal self-awareness may be of a different nature than the self-awareness that we associate with humans and upper primates. However, the possibility that our plant systems may be aware of the environmental insults that are being wrought upon them should make us reconsider our anthropocentric activities, as well as the possibility that humanity may need to collaborate with other intelligent non-human earth-based life forms to ensure mutual survival.}

KCaBi, as a high-throughput screening semiconductor with ultralow κl [J. Am. Chem. Soc. 144, 4448 (2022)], has been demonstrated that the contribution of optical phonons plays an important role in thermal transport. In this work, by solving the Boltzmann transport equation, it is found that the κl of KCaBi is 2.2 at 300K, with acoustic phonons dominating the z-direction κl and optical phonons contributing around 50% to the x-direction κl under the four-phonon picture. The uncommon contribution of optical phonons also manifests the possibility of tuning the κl anisotropy based on optical phonons. Following this line of thinking, it is found that applying tensile strain can cause a more pronounced decrease of acoustic phonon contribution than that of optical counterpart due to the highly dispersive optical branches, thus enhancing the anisotropic ratio of κl. Moreover, the microscopic mechanism is elucidated by analyzing the phonon dispersion relation, phonon mode-wise contribution and phonon scattering rates. Our study could provide appealing alternatives for the regulation of phonon transport from the viewpoint of optical phonons.}

Two robotic sheet metal folding projects were developed. The first, an example of tool programming, took advantage of an engineering approach and was focused on the affordances of the tool (an industrial robotic arm). The second project, one of material programming, employed a design methodology and was directed towards the affordances of the material (i.e., stainless steel sheet metal). By discussing the advantages and disadvantages of each approach, this research argues that both engineering and design should be considered required and complementary processes in the development of new creative fabrication solutions, allowing them to and make the overall production process more efficient.}

While previous studies have extensively examined various influencing factors, they often neglect the impact of behavioral inertia. To address this gap, this study conducts a behavioral experiment to quantitatively assess the presence and impact of behavioral inertia on residents' governance and financial participation behaviors. A total of 576 valid survey questionnaires were collected, and conditional logit model and ordered logit model were utilized for analysis. The study reveals that behavioral inertia is indeed observable in residents' governance participation and financial participation behaviors. Furthermore, the findings underscore distinct drivers of behavioral inertia for these two types of participation behaviors, with emotional reactions predominantly influencing governance participation, while short-term thinking largely shapes financial participation. Theoretically, this study uses the innovative concept of “behavioral inertia” to offer a new explanatory framework for aspects of behavior that cannot be solely explained by the attributes of regeneration plans. Furthermore, the behavioral experiments utilized in this study exemplify how the research framework of behavioral science can be applied to the study of urban governance in a broad context internationally. Practically, the research findings provide valuable insights for urban policymakers to tailor measures aimed at promoting resident participation and fostering sustainable urban development.}

Mental models are related to the concept of meaning and language comprehension; in other words, comprehending a linguistic message means that an appropriate mental model has been formed. The manipulation of mental models corresponds to thinking, and it is the manipulation that generates emergent ideas. The chapter discusses the importance of considering the ways ideas combine and presents the data from two experiments that illustrate the combination of ideas. The chapter illustrates the major implications for the theories of mental models. The first implication is that the computational theories cannot account for the data. The second implication is that something like embodiment is needed, and the chapter outlines one account of embodied mental models. The third implication is the most important and most controversial. It is that the human cognition is not a computational phenomenon.}

Cell adhesions are crucial to maintain tissue integrity and cellular communication. Communication and sensing occur through the transmittal of forces through adhesions. This relevant role motivated researchers to develop theoretical models of adhesion. Initial models were based on studies of association kinetics of proteins, which later were expanded to explicitly include the role of force in determining bond strength. The introduction of techniques that allowed measurements of force in the range of a single adhesion produced models that describe the inner workings of the adhesion molecules themselves. Despite the relative simplicity of these models, they are still relevant. Not only were these studies novel and creative, they have been integrated into models describing larger cellular aggregates, unraveling the role of mechanics in biology. These models have been used in the study of cell migration, developmental biology, and cancer biology.}

In this paper several approaches relevant to modeling of the mind are outlined. Since direct modeling of the brain functions is rather limited due to the complexity of such models a number of approximations is introduced. The path from the brain, or computational neurosciences, to the mind, or cognitive sciences, is sketched, with emphasis on higher cognitive functions such as memory and consciousness. No fundamental problems in understanding of the mind seem to arise. From a computational point of view realistic models require massively parallel architectures.}

We discuss approaches and content at both the unit learning level and at the curriculum level that will enhance the graduates’ capabilities to meet the future challenges they will be facing. PSE principles are important in their own right, but importantly they provide significant opportunities to aid the integration of learning in the basic and engineering sciences across the whole curriculum.

abstract = {This report describes a computational method developed to predict systemic exposure (s-exposure), chemical disposition {(CD) intestinal absorption, transport, membrane permeability, distribution, sequestration, phospholipidosis and toxicokinetics} of organic chemicals in humans. The method qualitatively and quantitatively estimates a chemical's CD activity profile based upon computed molecular descriptor properties (descriptors), and it facilitates in silico signal-detection of data-gaps, prioritization, risk-ranking, read-across, and re-assessments (if mandated) of large sets of chemicals in a safety evaluation setting. The investigation used a reference set of 2372 marketed human pharmaceuticals to define decision rules for an optimal chemical space (OCS) in which chemicals have high s-exposure, good CD, and a potential for chemical toxicity (CT); conversely, chemicals outside the OCS have low s-exposure, poor CD into the body, and low potential for CT. The method requires computation of 29 descriptors, identification of OCS molecular descriptor property violations (descriptor_violations), and alignment of descriptor_violations with specific decision rules for individual CD endpoint activities. The investigation predicted the CD activities of food and cosmetic preservatives, ingredients in GRAS (generally recognized as safe). Notices submitted to the FDA, reference pharmaceuticals, and it provides prioritization metrics and indices that facilitate prioritization of chemical in silico computed CD activities.}

We view the learner as a scientist who must divide her time between doing experiments and deducing predictions from promising theories, and we wish to know how she can do so most effectively. We explore several approaches based on the cost of making a prediction relative to the cost of performing an experiment. The resulting strategies share many qualitative characteristics with "real" science. This model is significant for the following reasons: •It allows us to study how a scientist might go about acquiring knowledge in a world where (as in real life) both performing experiments and making predictions from theories require time and effort.•It lays the foundation for a rigorous machine-implementable notion of "subjective probability." Good (1959, , 443-447) argues persuasively that subjective probability is at the heart of probability theory. Previous treatments of subjective probability do not handle the complication that the learner′s subjective probabilities may change as the result of pure thinking; our model captures this and other effects in a realistic manner. In addition, we begin to answer the question of how to trade off versus -a question that is fundamental for computers that must exist in the world and learn from their experience.}

abstract = {CONTEXT
Big data applications in agriculture evolve fast, as more experience, applications, good practices and computational power become available. Actual solutions to real-life problems are scarce. What characterizes the adoption of big data problems to solutions and to what extent is there a match between them?
OBJECTIVE
We aim to assess the conditions of the adoption of big data technologies in agricultural applications, based on the investigation of twelve real-life practical use cases in the precision agriculture and livestock domain.
METHODS
We use a mixed method approach: a case study research around the twelve use cases of Horizon 2020 project CYBELE, varying from precision arable and livestock farming to fishing and food security, and a stakeholder survey (n = 56). Our analysis focuses on four perspectives: (1) the drivers of change that initiated the use cases; (2) the big data characteristics of the problem; (3) the technological maturity level of the solution both at start and end of the project; (4) the stakeholder perspective.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
Results show that the use cases’ drivers of change are a combination of data-, technology, research- and commercial interests; most have at least a research drive. The big data characteristics (volume, velocity, variety, veracity) are well-represented, with most emphasis on velocity and variety. Technology readiness levels show that the majority of use cases started at experimental or lab environment stage and aims at a technical maturity of real-world small-scale deployment. Stakeholders’ main concern is cost, user friendliness and to embed the solution within their current work practice. The adoption of better-matching big data solutions is modest. Big data solutions do not work out-of-the-box when changing application domains. Additional technology development is needed for addressing the idiosyncrasies of agricultural applications.
SIGNIFICANCE
We add a practical, empirical assessment of the current status of big data problems and solutions to the existing body of mainly theoretical knowledge. We considered the CYBELE research project as our laboratory for this. Our strength is that we interviewed the use case representatives in person, and that we included the stakeholders’ perspective in our results. Large-scale deployments need effective interdisciplinary approaches and long-term project horizons to address issues emerging from big data characteristics, and to avoid compartmentalization of agricultural sciences. We need both an engineering perspective – to make things work in practice – and a systems thinking perspective – to offer holistic, integrated solutions.}

abstract = {The self-assembly behavior of shape-anisotropic particles at curved fluid interfaces is computationally investigated by diffuse interface field approach (DIFA). A Gibbs–Duhem-type thermodynamic formalism is introduced to treat heterogeneous pressure within the phenomenological model, in agreement with Young–Laplace equation. Computer simulations are performed to study the effects of capillary forces (interfacial tension and Laplace pressure) on particle self-assembly at fluid interfaces in various two-dimensional cases. For isolated particles, it is found that the equilibrium liquid interface remains circular and particles of different shapes do not disturb the homogeneous curvature of liquid interface, while the equilibrium position, orientation and stability of a particle at the liquid interface depend on its shape and initial location with respect to the liquid interface. For interacting particles, the curvature of local liquid interfaces is different from the apparent curvature of the particle shell; nevertheless, irrespective of the particle shapes, a particle-coated droplet always tends to deform into a circular morphology under positive Laplace pressure, loses mechanical stability and collapses under negative Laplace pressure, while adapts to any morphology and stays in neutral equilibrium under zero Laplace pressure. Finally, the collective behaviors of particles and Laplace pressure evolution in bicontinuous interfacially jammed emulsion gels (bijels) are investigated.}

In many countries, like Brazil and Portugal, isolated initiatives have been launched to promote CT learning, but until now there is no evidence of a widespread use of this type of environments. Consequently, it is not common that students that reach higher education nowadays are familiar with CT and programming. This paper presents the development of a serious game to support the learning of basic computer programming. It is a blocks-based environment including also resources that allow the teacher to follow the student’s progress and customize in-game tasks. Four cycles of experiments were conducted, improving both the game and how it was used. Based on the results of these experiences, the key contribution of this paper is a set of fourteen findings and recommendations to the creation and use of a game-based approach to support introductory computer programming learning for novices.}

The paper is framed in a theoretical approach, viewing students’ participation in scientific practices, and the development of higher-order thinking as necessary goals of science education. We argue that the focus on competencies, characterized as the ability to apply knowledge and skills in new contexts, involves a major change towards knowledge transfer and higher-order thinking skills. Some issues emerging from the analysis relate to the implications of assessment criteria and the challenges involved in its implementation, to the trends in teacher professional development and the difficulties related to the current economic crisis and to the results of the diagnostic evaluation and time frame needed for reforms to have an impact. It is argued that the development of both competencies and higher-order thinking requires students’ prolonged engagement.}

It is argued that within the formal settings of preschool education, through developmentally appropriate activities, opportunities may be implemented in order to encourage children as future citizens to construct risk literate personalities. It is concluded that risk perception and management imply awareness, assessment, avoidance and adaptation and are connected with growth, maturity, practice, experiences, intuitions and computations.}

Thus this paper develops a system-based methodology wherein a set of KPIs is computed in order to verify if the objectives of the production and maintenance systems are satisfied. In order to help the decision-making process for maintenance managers, a “unified” generic model have been developed. This model integrates (a) the interactions of the maintenance system with its enabling systems, (b) the impact of the maintenance strategies through the computation of some key performance indicators, and (c) different kinds of knowledge regarding the maintenance system and the system of interest, including quantitative and qualitative knowledge.

Several neurobiological risk factors for schizophrenia (NMDAR and GABAergic interneuron hypofunction) reduce both synaptic and “oscillatory” gain at high hierarchical areas. This could impair the encoding of precision at higher levels of the brain’s hierarchical model and increase expected precision at lower levels. This imbalance can account for many neurobiological and phenomenological findings in schizophrenia. Striatal D2R hyperactivity may increase the precision of current policies by inhibiting behavioral or cognitive switching. This could be a (dysfunctional) consequence of or even an attempt to compensate for prefrontal or hippocampal pathology. This D2R hyperactivity may also reduce learning from positive outcomes and affect the encoding of motivational (or informational) salience.}

abstract = {Background
The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the digitalization of modern society, extending digital transformation to daily life and psychological evaluation and treatment. However, the development of competencies and literacy in handling digital technology has not kept pace, resulting in a significant disparity among individuals. Existing measurements of digital literacy were developed before widespread information and communications technology device adoption, mainly focusing on one’s perceptions of their proficiency and the utility of device operation. In the contemporary landscape, digital transformation is evolving within specialized domains, necessitating a comprehensive evaluation of digital competencies, attitudes, and proficiency in technology application to bridge the digital divide and ensure digital compliance.
Objective
This study was designed to address the shortcomings of existing scales and formulate a digital sensitivity scale tailored to the requirements of today’s society.
Methods
Initial items of the Yongin Severance Digital Sensitivity Scale (YI-DSS) were collected through a literature review, and expert opinions were gathered to ensure content validity. An exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis included 986 adult participants evaluating 14 digital literacy items and 6 digital efficacy items. The Cronbach α confirmed internal consistency reliability, and 2-tailed t tests, ANOVAs, and post hoc tests analyzed demographic differences in digital literacy and efficacy.
Results
A robust 4-factor digital literacy solution was identified: digital application, digital communication, critical thinking, and digital ethics (Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin=0.891; Bartlett × 2=9829.713; P<.001; Cronbach α=0.782-0.947). A 2-factor solution defined digital efficacy: digital confidence and digital anxiety (Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin=0.735; Bartlett × 2=3282.217; P<.001; Cronbach α=0.787-0.912). Confirmatory factor analysis was conducted for each model (digital literacy model: χ271=676.0, comparative fit index=0.938, Tucker-Lewis index=0.921, standardized root mean square residual=0.73, and root mean square error of approximation=0.093; digital efficacy model: χ28=81.9, comparative fit index=0.977, Tucker-Lewis index=0.958, standardized root mean square residual=0.73, and root mean square error of approximation=0.097), which indicated a good fit. The YI-DSS also showed high correlation with the previously developed Digital Literacy Scale (r=0.809; P<.001).
Conclusions
The YI-DSS, as a self-assessment tool, has the potential to bridge the generational information gap by promoting acceptance, motivation, and adaptation to digital technology. Furthermore, given the remote nature of digital therapeutics, an individual’s familiarity with required technologies and digital communication strongly influences their acceptance of digital treatments and the efficacy thereof. This scale can play a pivotal role in enhancing compliance with digital therapeutics by preemptively assessing individuals’ technological literacy and competency.}

This paper presents an efficient evolutionary method for a constrained ED problem using the new adaptive particle swarm optimization (NAPSO) algorithm. The original PSO has difficulties in premature convergence, performance and the diversity loss in optimization process as well as appropriate tuning of its parameters. In the proposed algorithm, to improve the global searching capability and prevent the convergence to local minima, a new mutation is integrated with adaptive particle swarm optimization (APSO). In APSO, the inertia weight is tuned by using fuzzy IF/THEN rules and the cognitive and the social parameters are self-adaptively adjusted. The proposed NAPSO algorithm is validated on test systems consisting of 6, 10, 15, 40 and 80 generators with the objective functions possessing prohibited zones, multi-fuel effects and valve-point loading effects. The research results reveal the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed algorithm to the practical ED problem.}

abstract = {E-learning systems output a huge quantity of data on a learning process. However, it takes a lot of specialist human resources to manually process these data and generate an assessment report. Additionally, for formative assessment, the report should state the attainment level of the learning goals defined by the instructor. This paper describes the use of the granular linguistic model of a phenomenon (GLMP) to model the assessment of the learning process and implement the automated generation of an assessment report. GLMP is based on fuzzy logic and the computational theory of perceptions. This technique is useful for implementing complex assessment criteria using inference systems based on linguistic rules. Apart from the grade, the model also generates a detailed natural language progress report on the achieved proficiency level, based exclusively on the objective data gathered from correct and incorrect responses. This is illustrated by applying the model to the assessment of Dijkstra’s algorithm learning using a visual simulation-based graph algorithm learning environment, called GRAPHs.}

We address this disconnect by proposing and testing (via protocol analysis) the cognitive co-evolution model. Our model comprises a new approach to co-evolutionary design theory by explaining both the progression of the process itself and the creation of design outputs via an interplay between metacognitive perceived uncertainty, cognition, and the external world. We thus connect explanations of how designers think with descriptions of how they act. We provide a foundation for connecting to other theories, models, and questions in design research via common links to cognition and metacognition.}

Here we explored whether biologically defined temperamental traits determine differences in the ability to orient spatial attention as a function of the probabilistic association between cues and targets. To this aim, we administered the Structure of Temperament Questionnaire (STQ-77) to a sample of 151 participants who also performed a Posner task with central endogenous predictive (80 % valid/20 % invalid) or non-predictive cues (50 % valid/50 % invalid). We found that only participants with high scores in Plasticity and Intellectual Endurance showed a selective abatement of attentional costs with non-predictive cues. In addition, stepwise regression showed that costs in the non-predictive condition were negatively predicted by scores in Plasticity and positively predicted by scores in Probabilistic Thinking. These results show that stable temperamental characteristics play an important role in defining the inter-individual differences in attentional behaviour, especially in the presence of different probabilistic organisations of the sensory environment. These findings emphasize the importance of considering temperamental and personality traits in social and professional environments where the ability to control one's attention is a crucial functional skill.}

As an initial step towards critical AI education, we conducted a 10-year scoping review to identify publications reporting on activities that engage children, between the ages of 5 and 18, to address the critical implications of AI. Our review identifies a wide range of participants, content, and pedagogical approaches. Through framework synthesis guided by an established critical literacy model, we examine the critical literacy learning objectives embedded in the reported activities and propose a critical AI literacy framework.

Adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus leads to the incorporation of thousands of new granule cells into the dentate gyrus every month, but its function remains unclear. Here, we present computational evidence that indicates that adult neurogenesis may make three separate but related contributions to memory formation. First, immature neurons introduce a degree of similarity to memories learned at the same time, a process we refer to as pattern integration. Second, the extended maturation and change in excitability of these neurons make this added similarity a time-dependent effect, supporting the possibility that temporal information is included in new hippocampal memories. Finally, our model suggests that the experience-dependent addition of neurons results in a dentate gyrus network well suited for encoding new memories in familiar contexts while treating novel contexts differently. Taken together, these results indicate that new granule cells may affect hippocampal function in several unique and previously unpredicted ways.}

Primitives of interpretation can be correctly viewed intentionally, as explanations of our choices of linguistic actions; the model therefore fits our intuitions about meaning in conversation. Nevertheless, interpretations for complex utterances can be built from these primitives by simple operations of grammatical derivation. In bridging analyses of meaning at semantic and symbol-processing levels, this account underscores the fundamental place for computation in the cognitive science of language use.}

The number of intervening trials (lag) between successive presentations of members of the same category varied from two to eight. Subjects' naming latencies were slowed by 30ms for each preceding member of the category. This effect was both cumulative and linear, and unrelated to the lag elapsing since the previous presentation of a category member. These results definitively demonstrate the occurrence of cumulative interference for word retrieval by prior retrieval of other exemplars of the same semantic category—cumulative semantic inhibition. We claim that this inhibition effect could only occur if the spoken word production system possesses three specific properties (competition, priming, and sharing of semantic activation). We provide computational-modelling evidence in support of this claim. We show that no current theory of spoken word production has all of these properties. In their current form, all these theories are falsified by these results. We briefly discuss the obstacles that may be encountered by current models were they modified to account for our findings.}

We then describe a recently proposed practical framework, which quantifies natural language learnability, allowing specific learnability predictions to be made for the first time. In previous work, this framework was used to make learnability predictions for a wide variety of linguistic constructions, for which learnability has been much debated.

Based on a set of global exemplars, this Perspective Essay outlines six key factors that can enhance efficacy of 3D digital environments to guide knowledge-informed landscape and urban planning. We call for (1) explicitly representing dynamic interplay between the social, ecological, and technical systems, (2) exploring the integration of design with simulation models to address cross-scale dynamics, (3) developing features to foster imagination, (4) employing multisensory stimuli to encourage profound changes in environmentally and socially sustainable behavior, (5) tailoring the incorporation of active sensing by and with non-experts into 3D digital environments to better acknowledge indigenous and local knowledge systems, and finally, (6) carrying out a usability evaluation to facilitate participation and collaboration in an efficient co-creation process. We conclude by recommending the establishment of a collaborative knowledge platform that unites researchers, developers, and stakeholders for stimulating social-ecological-technological system thinking in the development of 3D digital environments and harnessing the technological advancements to accelerate and drive the needed transformative change within urban and landscape planning.}

Nurses are essential for assessing and managing acute pain in hospitalized patients, especially those who are unable to self-report pain. Given their role and subject matter expertise (SME), nurses are also essential for the design and development of a supervised machine learning (ML) model for pain detection and clinical decision support software (CDSS) in a pain recognition automated monitoring system (PRAMS). Our first step for developing PRAMS with nurses was to create SME-friendly data labeling software.
Purpose
To develop an intuitive and efficient data labeling software solution, Human-to-Artificial Intelligence (H2AI).
Method
The Human-centered Design for Embedded Machine Learning Solutions (HCDe-MLS) model was used to engage nurses. In this paper, HCDe-MLS will be explained using H2AI and PRAMS as illustrative cases.
Findings
Using HCDe-MLS, H2AI was developed and facilitated labeling of 139 videos (mean = 29.83 min) with 3189 images labeled (mean = 75 s) by 6 nurses. OpenCV was used for video-to-image pre-processing; and MobileFaceNet was used for default landmark placement on images. H2AI randomly assigned videos to nurses for data labeling, tracked labelers’ inter-rater reliability, and stored labeled data to train ML models.
Conclusions
Nurses’ engagement in CDSS development was critical for ensuring the end-product addressed nurses’ priorities, reflected nurses’ cognitive and decision-making processes, and garnered nurses’ trust for technology adoption.}

A novel approach towards cutting pattern generation is the so-called Variation of Reference Strategy (VaReS) [1], which minimizes the total potential energy arising from the motion of a planar cutting pattern to its corresponding three-dimensional shape. With non-uniform rational B-Splines (NURBS) being the standard tool for geometry description in CAD, it is only consequent to use these for analysis as well. Isogeometric B-Rep Analysis (IBRA) [2] follows up on this idea and enriches the original Isogeometric Analysis (IGA), which was introduced by Hughes et al. [3], by the possibility of analysing trimmed NURBS geometries. This paper presents cutting pattern generation with the Variation of Reference Strategy in the context of IGA/IBRA. With this approach, the whole design of a membrane structure can be represented by NURBS geometries – including blueprint plans. To use the benefits of IBRA for cutting pattern generation, a NURBS-based membrane-element was developed for the VaReS routine. A developable surface serves as a benchmark example, since its analytical cutting pattern is known. Examples of double-curved geometries show the applicability and benefits of the proposed procedure for real structures.}

It has been alleged that, in appropriate verbal contexts, man and he are generic, i.e. that the words include women as well as men, as for example in, Man is mortal, or One must watch his language. Many feminists argue for the elimination of this generic use of man and he and the substitution of such non-male words as people and they. Others argue on various grounds that these changes are unnecessary. This paper isolates the issues involved in such arguments and provisionally concludes that a reduction in the generic use of man and he would result in a long term reduction in sexist thinking. Recent feminist research on man and he is carefully reviewed. In its final section, the paper develops the implication that women experience more alienation than men in the presence of the generic man and he.}

abstract = {Serotonin has been associated with a wide range of neural computations and behaviours, yet an overarching function of this neurotransmitter has been hard to pinpoint. Here, we combine recent theories and findings on serotonin and propose a framework where serotonin integrates information on resource availability and state value to represent a cost–benefit trade-off at the neural level. Critically, this framework supports meta-decision making, that is, the flexible allocation of resources to decision-making. We highlight a computational and neural implementation of this framework, and through this novel, lens interpret empirical findings in the domains of controllability and persistence.}

abstract = {The induction problem of inferring a predictive function (i.e., model) from finite data is a central component of the scientific enterprise in cognitive science, computer science and statistics, and yet the problem is fundamentally ill posed. Many models can often provide equally good fits to a given observed data set but they may differ considerably in their ability to generalize to new, as yet unseen, data sets generated from the same underlying process. To make this inductive inference problem well posed one needs to define a justifiable measure of generalizability and then use the measure to choose among a set of competing models. Many such measures have been proposed in the past, notably by scientists in the fields of machine learning and algorithmic coding theory. A representative list of such approaches includes the structural risk minimization method and Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension, the regularization theory, and the minimum description length principle. This article presents a review of these computational approaches to model evaluation. Also discussed are the interesting connections between the computational approaches and some of the statistical approaches to model evaluation such as the Akaike information criterion, the Bayesian information criterion and Bayesian model selection.}

abstract = {Children who hear large amounts of diverse speech learn language more quickly than children who do not. However, high correlations between the amount and the diversity of the input in speech samples makes it difficult to isolate the influence of each. We overcame this problem by controlling the input to a computational model so that amount of exposure to linguistic input (quantity) and the quality of that input (lexical diversity) were independently manipulated. Sublexical, lexical, and multi-word knowledge were charted across development (Study 1), showing that while input quantity may be important early in learning, lexical diversity is ultimately more crucial, a prediction confirmed against children’s data (Study 2). The model trained on a lexically diverse input also performed better on nonword repetition and sentence recall tests (Study 3) and was quicker to learn new words over time (Study 4). A language input that is rich in lexical diversity outperforms equivalent richness in quantity for learned sublexical and lexical knowledge, for well-established language tests, and for acquiring words that have never been encountered before.}

abstract = {Successful materials innovations can transform society. However, materials research often involves long timelines and low success probabilities, dissuading investors who have expectations of shorter times from bench to business. A combination of emergent technologies could accelerate the pace of novel materials development by ten times or more, aligning the timelines of stakeholders (investors and researchers), markets, and the environment, while increasing return on investment. First, tool automation enables rapid experimental testing of candidate materials. Second, high-performance computing concentrates experimental bandwidth on promising compounds by predicting and inferring bulk, interface, and defect-related properties. Third, machine learning connects the former two, where experimental outputs automatically refine theory and help define next experiments. We describe state-of-the-art attempts to realize this vision and identify resource gaps. We posit that over the coming decade, this combination of tools will transform the way we perform materials research, with considerable first-mover advantages at stake.}

abstract = {The aim of this paper is twofold. First, we provide a methodological pathway from theories of situated, embodied cognition to simulations with an eye to empirical evidence, and suggest a possible cross-fertilization between cognitive robotics and psychology. Psychological theories, in particular those formulated at an abstract level, include models which are often severely underspecified at the level of mechanisms. This is true in the synchronic, constructive perspective (how can the effects observed in experiments be concretely generated by the model's mechanisms?) and in the diachronic, developmental perspective (how can such mechanisms be learned and developed?). The synthetic method of artificial cognitive systems research, and in particular of cognitive robotics, can complement research in psychology (and neurosciences) by exploring the constructive and developmental aspects of theories. Our second aim is to provide an example of such a methodology by describing simulations aiming at developing a perceptual symbol system (PSS) (Barsalou, 1999). We then describe the two main theoretical constructs of the PSS, perceptual symbols and simulators, illustrate their development in an artificial system, and test the system in prediction, categorization, and abstraction tasks.}

abstract = {The present study employed commercial computational fluid dynamics software ANSYS 2019R3 to explore the adiabatic film cooling effectiveness and the net heat flux reduction (NHFR) for the comparison of the five selected shaped holes and conventional cylindrical holes between the pressure surface, the suction surface and the leading edge. Amo4ng the shape parameters of shaped holes, the lateral divergence angle (β) and the forward divergence angle (δ) were fixed as 12° and 7° in all shaped holes structures, respectively. The others varied with different regions of the turbine vane. Results showed that different holes fit different positions of vanes. On the suction surface, laidback holes performed the worst net heat flux reduction in most blowing ratios conditions, which indicated the forward divergence angle was not conducive to the flow field and heat transfer characteristics on the suction surface. Whereas, the lateral divergence angle was beneficial to the film cooling and heat transfer characteristics. Laidback fan-shaped holes performed the best adiabatic film cooling effectiveness, but once simultaneously thinking about the heat transfer, fan-shaped holes performed better in net heat flux reduction due to less vortices at holes exit. On the leading edge, the divergence angle towards the upper wall (the lateral divergence angle of spanwise expansion holes) of vanes was not conducive to steady flow. And conical holes performed best, which indicated that coolant from holes with axial divergence angles (the lateral divergence angle in axial direction of conical holes) under the influence of mainstream impact could perform higher film cooling effectiveness and more stable flow fields. On the pressure surface, holes had a lateral divergence angle in the direction of vane height, which was conducive to increasing the coolant coverage area and improving the ability to attach to the pressure surface. Additionally, the laidback hole case was observed the lowest net heat flux reduction when the blowing ratio was less than 2, which revealed that holes that expanded only in flow direction was not conducive to film cooling and heat transfer characteristics.}
