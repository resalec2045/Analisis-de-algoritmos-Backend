abstract = {Contemporary research has explored educational robotics, but it has not examined the development of computational thinking in the context of programming embodied interactions. Apart from the goal of the robot and how the robot will interact with its environment, another important aspect that should be taken into consideration is whether and how the user will physically interact with the robot. We recruited 36 middle school students to participate in a six-session robotics curriculum in an attempt to expand their learning in computational thinking. Participants were asked to develop interfaces for the remote control of a robot using diverse interaction styles from low-level to high-level embodiment, such as touch, speech, and hand and full-body gestures. We measured students’ perception of computing, examined their computational practices, and assessed the development of their computational thinking skills by analyzing the sophistication of the projects they created during a problem-solving task. We found that students who programmed combinations of low embodiment interfaces or interfaces with no embodiment produced more sophisticated projects and adopted more sophisticated computational practices compared to those who programmed full-body interfaces. These findings suggest that there might be a tradeoff between the appeal and the cognitive benefit of rich embodied interaction with a remotely controlled robot. In further work, educational robotics research and competitions might be complemented with a hybrid approach that blends the traditional autonomous robot movement with student enactment.},

abstract = {As computer science is integrated into a wider variety of fields, block-based programming languages like Snap!, which assemble code with visual blocks rather than text syntax, are increasingly used to teach computational thinking (CT) to students from diverse backgrounds. Although automated evaluators (autograders) for programming assignments usually focus on runtime efficiency and output accuracy, effective evaluation of a student's CT skills requires assessing coding best practices, such as decomposition, abstraction, and algorithm design. While autograders are commonplace for text languages like Python, we present a machine learning approach to assess how effectively block-based code demonstrates understanding of CT fundamentals. Our dataset consists of Snap! programs written by students new to coding and evaluated by instructors using a CT rubric. We explore how to best transform these programs into low-dimensional features to allow encapsulation and repetition patterns to emerge. Experimentation involves comparing the effectiveness of a suite of clustering models and similarity metrics by analyzing how directly automated feedback correlates to the course staff's manual evaluation. Lastly, we demonstrate the practical application of the autograder in a classroom setting and discuss scalability and feasibility in other domains of CS education.},

abstract = {Adversarial Thinking (AT) is essential in cybersecurity, fostering strategic problem-solving by anticipating worst-case scenarios. However, its integration into early computing education, especially in the first two years, remains underexplored. Introductory courses like CS 0 build foundational skills but are challenging to implement in resource-limited community colleges. Strengthening AT in these students can enhance their workforce readiness and support transfers to four-year programs. Servingness describes how Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs) go beyond merely enrolling Latinx students to address their specific cultural, academic, and social needs. It involves creating inclusive environments where students feel a strong sense of belonging, supported by culturally relevant practices, leadership opportunities, and community engagement. These environments generate feelings of being accepted, valued, and included within a community or group, also called a sense of belonging. This work presents research focused on the incorporation of AT within the first two years of computer science education at community colleges, in particular to a course CS 0. By examining the integration of AT principles in early coursework, the study identifies key characteristics and a sense of belonging that are instrumental in cultivating AT capabilities among students. The findings aim to offer actionable insights for educators in community colleges, enabling them to more effectively prepare students for the complexities of modern computing careers and to address the broader needs of the cybersecurity field. Through this targeted educational approach, students can develop a more robust understanding of adversarial strategies, enhancing their overall computational thinking and problem-solving skills.},

However, how coding kits are designed to welcome children of different genders remains unclear, a critical research gap given that computing is mostly a male-dominated field. Drawing on relevant literature, we develop a framework of gender-related design features in toys (i.e., boy-oriented, girl-oriented, or gender-neutral features) and employ it to examine gender-related design features in commercially available coding kits for young children aged seven and under (N=110). The findings reveal the lopsided gender representation in coding kits, e.g., their physical forms and supported coding activities are predominantly boy-oriented. We discuss design and research implications for coding kits to welcome participation from children of different genders, especially young girls whose preferred design features are underrepresented in current designs.},

abstract = {Teaching students to become skillful problem solvers is a goal of university education, but it has been difficult to measure such skill or demonstrate the benefits of particular educational experiences. This paper presents a study of college students solving a problem unrelated to their academic majors. The analysis suggests that the educational experiences of Computer Science (CS) students may better train them in problem-solving than the experiences of other majors. In this study, students from a variety of undergraduate majors and grade levels were given a 15-minute problem-solving task embedded in an interactive science simulation. The complex task calls upon many problem-solving practices needed by scientists and engineers in their professions. Although this task has little resemblance to the problems encountered in a computer science course, CS students performed significantly better than students in any other major. In addition, only for CS students was there an indication of improvement in problem-solving from lower to upper grade levels. We propose that general problem-solving and computational thinking share some common practices, such as problem decomposition and comprehensive data collection. Furthermore, we present preliminary evidence that training in computational thinking is transferable to problem-solving tasks across domains and discuss how the unique features of CS programming assignments could be generalized to other science and engineering courses to foster students' general problem-solving skills.},

abstract = {Engaging in physical computing activities involving both hardware and software provides a hands-on introduction to computer science. The move to remote learning for primary and secondary schools during the 2020-2021 school year due to COVID-19 made implementing physical computing activities especially challenging. However, it is important that these activities are not simply eliminated from the curriculum. This paper explores how a unit centered around students investigating how programmable sensors that can support data-driven scientific inquiry was collaboratively adapted for remote instruction. A case study of one teacher’s experience implementing the unit with a group of middle school students (ages 11 to 14) in her STEM elective class examines how her students could still engage in computational thinking practices around data and programming. The discussion includes both the challenges and unexpected affordances of engaging in physical computing activities remotely that emerged from her implementation.},

abstract = {With the growing demand for computational skills in the job market, it's imperative that lower secondary school students grasp basic programming concepts such as repetition, modularity, conditionals, and variables. Yet, many students perceive computer science as daunting and irrelevant. Physical computing offers a promising solution to this motivational gap. It enhances intrinsic motivation, self-efficacy, and positive attitudes towards technology. Moreover, they engage students who may not identify as typical programmers and foster essential computational thinking skills.This research investigates the efficacy of employing the same educational robot in different contexts, such as music, images, colors, and simple video games, while teaching basic programming concepts. We call this approach "multi-context physical computing'' to emphasize the focus on the different application scenarios. We believe that this could benefit students for two reasons. Firstly, by presenting the same concept across different contexts, learners can better grasp the essence of the concept, disentangling it from extraneous contextual associations. Secondly, catering to individual interests by offering diverse contexts may enhance motivation, consequently fostering improved learning outcomes, as predicted by the expectancy-value theory.In order to assess the benefits of the multi-context approach on learning outcomes and motivation, we will compare it to a more traditional single-context approach centered on robot locomotion in a randomized controlled study.},

Twenty-six middle school students were asked to program interfaces for controlling the heading and speed of a robot using two types of embodied interaction modalities. We compared touch and full-body gestures to autonomous control, which does not require any embodied interaction. We assessed the development of their computational thinking skills by analyzing the projects they created during a problem-solving task and examined their understandings of science concepts related to kinematics. We found that novice students preferred full-body interfaces, while advanced students moved to more disembodied and abstract computational thinking. These findings might be applied to focus computing and science education activities to the right age and abilities groups of students.},

In this paper, we present the results of an observational study, having as a working setting a coding camp based on Computational Thinking (CT), to explore how peer-led coding camps can create a seed effect in young students. In particular, we analyze how a practical approach to convey CT skills motivates and effectively prepares student tutors. Moreover, we compare the previous and next edition of the camp to identify the specific contribution of the tutors. We observed that students benefit in particular from CT perspectives and develop the necessary motivation to eventually serve as tutors, creating a multiplier effect that benefits a larger number of students of future cohorts. Moreover, our results show that student tutors contributed positively to the facilitation of the subsequent edition of the coding camp.},

abstract = {As reliance on technology increases in practically every aspect of life, all students deserve the opportunity to learn to think computationally from early in their educational experience. To support the kinds of computer science curriculum and instruction that makes this possible, there is an urgent need to develop and validate computational thinking (CT) assessments for elementary-aged students. We developed the Assessment of Computing for Elementary Students (ACES) to measure the CT concepts of loops and sequences for students in grades 3-5. The ACES includes block-based coding questions as well as non-programming, Bebras-style questions. We conducted cognitive interviews to understand student perspectives while taking the ACES. We piloted the assessment with 57 4th grade students who had completed a CT curriculum. Preliminary analyses indicate acceptable reliability and appropriate difficulty and discrimination among assessment items. The significance of this paper is to present a new CT measure for upper elementary students and to share its intentional development process.},

abstract = {Many children begin to learn to code in a self-directed context, such as by creating an animation, game or phone app. Recent research has begun to investigate and evaluate the results of this process: children's projects. However, little is known about the different trajectories novices have during the long-term process of self-directed programming learning. Our aim is to identify the existing types of trajectories and be able to determine a specific child's trajectory. If that trajectory does not lead to significant progress or continued motivation, we might be able to nudge them toward a different trajectory.We hypothesized that there may be several main types of trajectories. To explore this, we clustered children's programming progression in order to identify trends. We used a data set of Scratch programs for its large sample size and diverse population [1,3]. We used Dr. Scratch's scoring of computational thinking skills as our initial feature set [2]. Our clustering analysis identified two main groups of users. The first group, 55.8\% of users, generally progressed upward over time in their computational thinking skill score. The second group, 44.2\% of users, showed little to no improvement over time.These preliminary results raise many questions about these two high-level groupings of trajectories of computational thinking skill demonstration in Scratch projects. In the future we want to further explore the trajectory clusters and what they could mean for supporting self-directed learning of programming.},

abstract = {Computer scientists have been working towards a common definition of abstraction; however, the instruction and assessment of abstraction remain categorically under-researched. Abstraction is often cited as a component of computational thinking and can be likened to a higher order thinking skill. Most K-12 educators have studied critical thinking (e.g., Bloom's taxonomy, Marzano \&amp; Kendall's new taxonomy) more than computational thinking. Overlapping characteristics of abstraction and critical thinking can provide educators with instructional guidance. The qualitative examination of how teachers determine curriculum, deliver instruction, and design assessments in K-12 computer science education contributes insights into current instructional practices and variables for future quantitative study. The instructional strategies, objectives, and assessments of 12 K-12 computer science teachers from three states in the United States were examined in this descriptive qualitative examination of instruction using thematic coding analysis. The majority of teachers interviewed had little to no professional development regarding teaching abstraction. All teachers in the study were unsure what student abstraction abilities should be according to grade level. Teachers' understanding of abstraction ranged from very little knowledge to very knowledgeable. The majority of teachers interviewed did not assess abstraction intentionally. Teachers described successfully teaching abstraction through multiple instructional practices and spiraling curriculum. This examination of abstraction in K-12 computer science education offers practical descriptive insights and illuminates additional variables for researching the instruction of abstraction qualitatively and quantitatively. Anecdotal instructional successes are included in the results.},

However, IoT's infiltration into education has been much slower, and educational tools that embody these features are few and far between. Together with the Chugach School District in Alaska, we investigated methods to teach middle-school aged students how to use IoT to drive change in their communities and collaborate in a digital world, tied to real time environmental data. The objective of this work is to provide rural, K-12 Alaskan students and teachers with opportunities that will help build an understanding of what is happening in their local environments, increase overall scientific and climate literacy, and contribute to community resilience and connectedness. Rural Alaskan students live in some of the most vulnerable regions of the planet, regions that are highly susceptible to the impacts of climate change. In this work-in-progress paper, we first discuss the design and adaptation of Tekniverse, a hardware and software ecosystem that provides a gateway for students to code and connect hardware projects and data. We then discuss the finding of our initial study of Tekniverse as a learning tool for computational thinking, data analysis, and social responsibility in rural and remote areas with students in Alaska. Lastly, we propose future directions for this research and computational collaborative tools.},

abstract = {Accessible introductory programming environments are scarce, and their study within ecological settings (e.g., at home) is almost non-existent. We present ACCembly, an accessible block-based environment that enables children with visual impairments to perform spatial programming activities. ACCembly allows children to assemble tangible blocks to program a multimodal robot. We evaluated this approach with seven families that used the system autonomously at home. Results showed that both the children and family members learned from what was an inclusive and engaging experience. Children leveraged fundamental computational thinking concepts to solve spatial programming challenges; parents took different roles as mediators, some actively teaching and scaffolding, others learning together with their child. We contribute with an environment that enables children with visual impairments to engage in spatial programming activities, an analysis of parent-child interactions, and reflections on inclusive programming environments within a shared family experience.},

abstract = {Background and Context. With increasing efforts to bring computing education opportunities into elementary schools, there is a growing need for assessments, with arguments for validity, to support research evaluation at these grade levels. After successfully piloting a 10-question computational thinking assessment (Assessment of Computing for Elementary Students – ACES) for 4th graders in Spring 2020, we used our analyses of item difficulty and discrimination to iterate on the assessment. Objectives. To increase the number of potential items for ACES, we created isomorphic versions of existing questions. The nature of the changes varied from incidental changes that we did not believe would impact student performance to more radical changes that seemed likely to influence question difficulty. We sought to understand the impact of these changes on student performance. Method. Using these isomorphic questions, we created two versions of our assessment and piloted them in Spring 2021 with 235 upper-elementary (4th grade) students. We analyzed the reliability of the assessments using Cronbach’s alpha. We used Chi-squared tests to analyze questions that were identical across the two assessments to form a baseline of comparison and then ran Chi-Squared and Kruskal-Wallis H tests to analyze the differences between the isomorphic copies of the questions. Findings. Both assessment versions demonstrated good reliability, with identical Cronbach’s alphas of 0.868. We found statistically similar performance on the identical questions between our two groups of students, allowing us to compare their performance on the isomorphic questions. Students performed differently on the isomorphic questions, indicating the changes to the questions had a differential impact on student performance. Implications. This paper builds on existing work by presenting methods for creating isomorphic questions. We provide valuable lessons learned, both on those methods and on the impact of specific types of changes on student performance.},

abstract = {In response to the shortcomings of the SPOC course "Introduction to Computational Thinking" at Beijing University of Civil Engineering and Architecture, the teaching team has transformed and improved the course design and practice based on the existing High quality undergraduate courses in Beijing universities and Beijing Curriculum Ideological and Political Demonstration Course. We aim to maintain consistency and linkage in learning objectives, learning assessments, teaching materials, learning activities, and course technology under the principle of consistent construction. Learning objectives are clearer and more measurable; learning assessment is more scientific, diverse, and reliable; Curriculum resources can meet the needs of students at different levels and majors; learning activities can fully mobilize students' subjective initiative; Curriculum technology helps to achieve learning objectives, and can reflect the characteristics of the discipline, with universality and progressiveness. Through the construction and practice of the FD-QM standard, the course team has established the principles of course standardization, clarified the direction of course material construction, drawn a knowledge graph of course knowledge points, accurately grasped the degree of learning objectives, upgraded the "characteristic" teaching resource library, enhanced student interest, and integrated ideological and political education into the curriculum, ultimately achieving a comprehensive improvement in the quality of course teaching.},
