abstract = {Technology can be both a bane and a boon to education. Social media apps and digital games offer rich and highly stimulating forms of engagement outside of the classroom. This level of stimulus has created challenges for traditional educational paradigms and approaches. A promising response is for educators to embrace technology through interactive apps and gamification.This workshop provides hands-on engagement with a collection of freely-available interactive web apps that focus on the development of visual, spatial, and computational thinking. The workshop concludes with participants playing a third-person Unity game in which the (interactive) standalone web apps presented in the workshop have been embedded. The game, inspired by Han Solo's Kessel run, involves a trek across a sequence of platforms located in a galaxy far far away. Teleportation from one platform to the next is enabled by correctly completing the activity contained in the embedded (and interactive) web apps and then having the player walk through a portal. The player game score is calculated based on the speed and accuracy of their engagement with the exercises present.},

abstract = {Providing opportunities for students to collaborate while developing their computational thinking (CT) is a challenge, particularly for remote collaboration. To address this issue, an interdisciplinary team derived a set of design rationales (integration of learning activities, scaffolding progression, cross-device interaction and supporting collaboration in all activities) and developed CoTinker: a collaborative, cross-device tool designed to foster equity in the form of equal participation amongst students. Through a pilot study, we investigated high-school students (n=15), working with CT activities supported by CoTinker, in the form of a computer model of a biological phenomenon. We found that CoTinker was able to support students’ remote collaborative work and participation equity. Furthermore, students were able to take advantage of cross-device interaction using their laptop and mobile phones in concert. We conclude that the design rationales and CoTinker design can serve as useful starting points for enabling equitable collaboration amongst students working with CT.},

abstract = {The usage of playful activities is common in introductory programming settings. There is normally a virtual character or a physical robot that has to collect items or reach a goal within a map. Visually, these activities tend to be exciting enough to maintain children engaged: there is constant feedback about the actions being performed, and the virtual environments tend to be stimulating and aesthetically pleasant. Conversely, in adaptations for visually impaired children, these environments tend to become poorer, damaging the story at the cost of the programming actions and its dull mechanics (e.g., place a arrow block to move the character forward). In this paper, we present TACTOPI, a playful environment designed from the ground up to be rich in both its story (a nautical game) and its mechanics (e.g., a physical robot-boat controlled with a 3D printed wheel), tailored to promote computational thinking at different levels (4 to 8 years old). This poster intends to provoke discussion and motivate accessibility researchers that are interested in computational thinking to make playfulness a priority.},

abstract = {Calls for standardized and validated measures of computational thinking have been made repeatedly in recent years. Still, few such tests have been created and even fewer have undergone rigorous psychometric evaluation and been made available to researchers. The purpose of this study is to report our work in developing and validating a test of computational thinking concepts and skills and to compare different scoring methods for the test. This computational thinking exam is intended to be used in computing education research as a common measure of computational thinking so that the research community will be able to make more meaningful comparisons across samples and studies. The Computational Thinking Concepts and Skills Test (CTCAST) was administered to students in several courses, evaluated and revised, and then administered to another group of students. Part of the revision included changing half of the items to a multiple-select format. The test scores using the three scoring methods were compared to each other and to scores on a different test of core computer science knowledge. Results indicate the CTCAST and the test of core computer science knowledge measure similar, but not identical, aspects of students' knowledge and skills, and that item-level statistics vary according to the scoring method that is used. Recommendations for using and scoring the test are presented.},

abstract = {We present reflections based on qualitative analysis of data from the CHEM+C Project which promotes computational thinking (CT) in classrooms through integration with science classes. The curriculum utilizes multiple representations, requiring students to work with physical phenomena, chemical equations, digital simulations, and modifiable code-based representations. Much CT focus on abstraction naturally emphasizes (1) extraction of a set of features from an object or process, and (2) finding commonality between objects and processes. But Rosen encourages us to think about abstraction as also including the production of new concepts or actions. Integrating CT into science offers the possibility of enhancing this aspect of abstraction. Changing the representational affordances available to the students allows them to take their CT thinking beyond learning-to-abstract towards learning-through-abstraction. This perspective moves computation from an internally focused exercise into the expression of valued ideas in a computational medium.},

abstract = {Computational thinking has recently gained more and more relevance as problem-solving competence of the 21st century. Taking Wing's [1] grand vision into account, each student should have certain skills in computational thinking in order to be able to participate adequately in social life and in his/her future profession. Thus, the International Computer and Information Literacy Study (ICILS 2018) does in addition to other student competences also measure their achievement in computational thinking [2]. In this internationally comparative large-scale assessment with a representative sample, a sound body of information is gathered that is used, among others, to explain variation in students' achievement in computational thinking. One field that represents a national extension in Germany is problem-solving. This paper presents a PhD project that focuses on this field and provides an analysis model that examines the relationship between students' self-perceived problem-solving skills and their computational thinking skills, taking into account further variables of influence and aims to explain variation in students' achievement of computational thinking.},

Women and men have benefited from this strategy, but no review of the results had been conducted to determine whether there is any difference in evaluation performance from a gender perspective. As in other countries, in Mexico there is an accentuated percentage difference in terms of men´s election for higher education studies in areas of science, technology, engineering and mathematics. This article sets out the data analysis when evaluating five skills associated with the concept of computational thinking, this means, decomposition, abstraction, generalization, algorithmic design and evaluation. The conclusion of the analysis states that there is no significant gender difference in the results of evaluation. Women and men who enter to study the first semester have similar conditions and opportunities for learning the contents and consequently acquire the respective competencies.},

abstract = {The acquisition of Computational Thinking (CT) skills is an essential goal of Computer Science (CS) education. Assessment of CT is critical for CS teaching and research. However, there is a paucity of developmentally appropriate CT measures designed for early elementary school children. Among existing measures, there has been little attention paid to methods for comparing CT skills across grades. In the present study, I examined the use of a normalized scoring system for comparing performance on three grade-specific versions of the TechCheck CT assessment. TechCheck is a brief, unplugged, multiple-choice instrument for children 5-9 years of age that probes six domains of CT. Baseline raw score TechCheck data from 596 students showed normal distributions with significant differences in means between grades. I calculated Z-scores and percentile ranks by grade. This normalization allowed for the comparison of CT skills within and across grades in the context of a pilot longitudinal study of the CAL-ScratchJr coding curriculum. Application of the normative scoring system showed a difference in the outcome of only 4 percentile ranks between first and second graders while raw scores indicated an improbable 45\% difference. This study demonstrates that normalized TechCheck scores that take into account differences in the score distributions across grades can improve the measurement of CT skills in the context of early childhood CS educational interventions.},

abstract = {In this study, we adapted the notion of framing, a theoretical construct that refers to a person's expectations about social spaces (Goffman, 1974), to investigate whether teachers viewed computational thinking (CT) according to subject-specific frames. This case study aimed to understand how teachers make connections between CT and subjects targeted for integration. Epistemological framing contributed new insights on why teachers connected CT in different ways to different subjects: frame shifting focused teachers' attention on goals and activities specific to each subject. As teachers attended to a subject's particularities, they drew upon different epistemic resources to construct their descriptions of CT. Our participants (n=6) were teachers who taught both 7th-12th grade computing and mathematics as separate subjects. Qualitative coding of interview transcripts revealed that teachers' ideas about CT in computing were strongly influenced by computer programming while their ideas about CT in mathematics corresponded with familiar ways of teaching and learning mathematics. Instead of accepting fragmented notions of CT as the price of integration into individual subjects, we propose limiting the scope when defining CT. We explain how this non-intuitive strategy can preserve the coherence of CT and how it might be used in CT professional development (PD) for mathematics teachers.},

abstract = {In recent years, computational thinking has once again received attention widely. Computational thinking is generally considered to be the ability to be acquired. However, this study is to use computational thinking as part of the learning method. In order to explore the application of computational thinking in teaching, this study first collected the main review papers, as well as the literature on the assessment of computational thinking, and examined their views. Then, this study proposes a learning method that integrates computational thinking into experiential learning theory and applies it to learning artificial intelligence techniques.},
