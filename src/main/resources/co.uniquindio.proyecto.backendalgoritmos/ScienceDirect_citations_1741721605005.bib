abstract = {With the advent of the Internet and the progressive development and consolidation of a wide range of web standards and technologies as well as the advances in distributed artificial intelligence (DAI), namely the multi agent system concept, new opportunities have emerged for conceiving, modelling and enhancing shop floor's performance and response. Modern IT-supported production paradigms denote a common concept where the shop floor is a lively entity composed by interacting intelligent modules whose individual and collective function adapts and evolves ensuring the fitness and adequacy of the organization, owning the system, in tackling profitable but volatile business opportunities. The self-organizing and peer to peer nature of these systems renders a collective behaviour and dynamics that are fundamentally new. Conventional diagnostic methods and tools have not been designed targeting the envisioned systems therefore lack the required support. In this paper the emerging IT-based production paradigms are surveyed as well as the existing diagnostic methods whose adequacy is analysed. The resulting requirements and characteristics are exposed to stress the need for rethinking current diagnostic practices in future automation systems.}

abstract = {Theory-driven and data-driven computational approaches to psychiatry have enormous potential for elucidating mechanism of disease and providing translational linkages between basic science findings and the clinic. These approaches have already demonstrated utility in providing clinically relevant understanding, primarily via back translation from clinic to computation, revealing how specific disorders or symptoms map onto specific computational processes. Nonetheless, forward translation, from computation to clinic, remains rare. In addition, consensus regarding specific barriers to forward translation—and on the best strategies to overcome these barriers—is limited. This perspective review brings together expert basic and computationally trained researchers and clinicians to 1) identify challenges specific to preclinical model systems and clinical translation of computational models of cognition and affect, and 2) discuss practical approaches to overcoming these challenges. In doing so, we highlight recent evidence for the ability of computational approaches to predict treatment responses in psychiatric disorders and discuss considerations for maximizing the clinical relevance of such models (e.g., via longitudinal testing) and the likelihood of stakeholder adoption (e.g., via cost-effectiveness analyses).}

abstract = {This study is an attempt to put in place the component of the general information theory that explains the macroscopic dynamics of the human thinking systems. The fundamental structure of such a theory must include the domains of external basic entity interactions, external basic entity and information-coded energy quantum transformations, and energy quantum and information-coded matter interactions. In this respect, a human thinking system is perceived to have at least a natural energy-matter subsystem and a human-created physical symbol subsystem. The artifacts of the human-created subsystem are the external basic physical entities, namely, data, information, knowledge, and wisdom. The intrinsic and interactive properties of these entities depict the characteristics of the physical symbol subsystem. Besides interacting among themselves, the external entities also interact with the natural entities, the information-coded energy quanta, according to certain rules and principles. Subsequently, the energy quanta interact with the information-coded matter structure. Such interactions occurring within the individual subsystems and between the two subsystems constitute the dynamics of the human thinking systems. In intelligent systems of this nature information can exist in physical, energy and matter forms, and the different forms are interconvertible. The interactions among these entities and the conversion of one form to another is made possible by the existence of an intelligence space in the human mind.}

However, there is a noticeable gap in understanding its influence on students' cognitive development from a multilevel perspective. This study delves into cognitive learning theories and aims to bridge the existing gap by introducing a three-level conceptual model to illustrate how the influence of SCP on students' cognitive CT abilities is mediated through the cognitive learning processes. This multilevel approach simultaneously explores SCP within the intricate school environment where factors at the school, teacher, and student levels are closely intertwined. Data was collected from 82 programming teachers and their 2433 students across 43 Hong Kong primary schools. Using multilevel modeling, results indicate that the adoption of SCP is significantly anchored by school support on teacher professional development (TPD), which in turn enhances students’ cognitive learning (i.e., active, interactive, constructive, and reflective learning) in class, further contributing to their enhanced cognitive CT abilities. The findings underscore the nuances of SCP adoption in school scenarios, advocating for strategic approaches to maximize student achievements in CT education. Recommendations for future research are discussed.}

However, interoperability challenges between retailer organizations and manufacturers present a barrier to decision-making processes and impact the human-centric nature of the IoV. Ethical dilemmas arise as a result of the IoV’s inability to prevent accidents, particularly in critical situations. This study aims to enhance the IoV’s effectiveness by carefully selecting and improving essential attributes from various data sources, including sensors, GPS, 5G or 6G communication networks, and real-time data provisioning. To achieve the aim of the proposed study, a Multi-criterion Decision-making (MCDM) approach is proposed, which allows for the analysis and selection of optimal choices while taking into account various quantitative and qualitative factors. Despite the challenges posed by complex models and ambiguous data, MCDM remains an indispensable technique for aligning transportation systems with current expectations. The CRITIC and TOPSIS MCDM-enabled methodologies are employed to analyze IoV architecture, prioritizing significant elements that impact system performance and identifying optimal solutions by considering complications from worst-case scenarios. The study will assist engineers, scientists, and organizations to develop smart IoV systems that will cater to human needs by improving mobility and inspiration among users.}

Why is this? Here, we integrate cognitive, neuroscientific, and computational approaches to understanding the effectiveness of enrichment and discuss recent neuroscience findings indicating that crossmodal responses in sensory and motor brain regions causally contribute to the behavioral benefits of enrichment. The findings provide novel evidence for multimodal theories of enriched learning, challenge assumptions of longstanding cognitive theories, and provide counterevidence to unimodal neurobiologically inspired theories. Enriched educational methods are likely effective not only because they may engage greater levels of attention or deeper levels of processing, but also because multimodal interactions in the brain can enhance learning and memory.}

abstract = {This paper makes a novel linkage between the multiple-computations theorem in philosophy of mind and Landauer's principle in physics. The multiple-computations theorem implies that certain physical systems implement simultaneously more than one computation. Landauer's principle implies that the physical implementation of “logically irreversible” functions is accompanied by minimal entropy increase. We show that the multiple-computations theorem is incompatible with, or at least challenges, the universal validity of Landauer's principle. To this end we provide accounts of both ideas in terms of low-level fundamental concepts in statistical mechanics, thus providing a deeper understanding of these ideas than their standard formulations given in the high-level terms of thermodynamics and cognitive science. Since Landauer's principle is pivotal in the attempts to derive the universal validity of the second law of thermodynamics in statistical mechanics, our result entails that the multiple-computations theorem has crucial implications with respect to the second law. Finally, our analysis contributes to the understanding of notions, such as “logical irreversibility,” “entropy increase,” “implementing a computation,” in terms of fundamental physics, and to resolving open questions in the literature of both fields, such as: what could it possibly mean that a certain physical process implements a certain computation.}

We use a method that maps text-objects into metric spaces for visualizing a user's thought space structure. Text-objects imply fragments of a user's idea, which have several keywords given by him/her. Spaces composed of text-objects are configured in the way “the higher the mutual relevance between a pair of text-objects is, the closer the text-objects are mapped”. The relevance values among text-objects are calculated due to cooccurrence of their keywords. Results of experiments with our implemented system, named CAT1 (computer-aided thinking, version 1), show that users of the system can get effective stimuli for further thinking in creative concept formation. The paper also discusses the potential application of CAT1 to collaborative work by groups of people.}

abstract = {This article introduces differentiated creative search (DCS), a groundbreaking optimization algorithm that revolutionizes traditional decision-making systems in complex environments. In contrast to conventional differential evolution methods, DCS integrates a unique knowledge-acquisition process with a creative realism paradigm, thereby transforming optimization strategies. The primary aim of DCS is to enhance decision-making efficacy by employing a newly proposed dual-strategy approach that balances divergent and convergent thinking within a team-based framework. High-performing members apply divergent thinking via the DCS/Xrand/Linnik(α,σ) strategy, which incorporates existing knowledge and Linnik flights. Conversely, the remaining team harnesses convergent thinking through the DCS/Xbest/Current-to-2rand strategy, which combines insights from both the team leader and fellow members. This division of labor, coupled with a strategy tailored to the performance levels of team members, allows for a dynamic and effective decision-making process. The methodology of DCS involves iterative cycles of divergent and convergent thinking, supported by a differentiated knowledge-acquisition process and retrospective assessments. The algorithm's novelty lies in its differentiated knowledge-acquisition, adjusted based on individual team member performance, fostering an environment of continuous learning and adaptation. The paper's contributions are demonstrated through rigorous testing of DCS on various benchmark functions, including CEC2017, classical, and sensor selection problems, as well as real-world applications such as car side impact design, gear train design, and FM sound wave parameter estimation. The results showcase the promising performance of DCS compared to that of existing algorithms, attributable to its innovative approach to problem solving and decision making in complex scenarios. The results and impact section highlights that DCS considerably outperforms traditional optimization algorithms, offering a robust and versatile tool for complex decision-making systems. Its impact is particularly notable in scenarios requiring a balance between innovative solutions and practical decision-making, making DCS a valuable asset in strategic planning and execution across various industries.}

abstract = {An analytical and adaptive parameter extraction method is proposed to accurately and efficiently extract the parameters of solar cells' triple-diode lumped-parameter equivalent circuit model. This method can obtain explicit expressions of parameters, facilitating seamless integration into photovoltaic systems for circuit-level simulation and design. The proposed method addresses the lack of analytical parameter extraction methods for triple-diode model, avoids the iteration of numerical methods, and significantly reduces computational complexity, thus improving the overall efficiency of the modeling process. In this method, the principle of effective-diode-based analysis is used to simplify the complex multi-diode model. Recursive thinking is then combined to adaptively extract all parameters through multiple steps according to the number of diodes in the model. Subsequently, the practicability of this method is evaluated by testing on three different equivalent circuit models of solar cells including the single-, double-, and triple-diode models. Furthermore, the universality of this method is demonstrated by testing on three photovoltaic modules of different types including Mono-crystalline, Multi-crystalline, Thin-film, and perovskite solar cells at different temperatures and irradiances. Finally, the simulation results based on the extracted parameters are compared with the experimental data to calculate the root mean square error (RMSE) magnitude, which ranges from 10−5 to 10−3, demonstrating the feasibility of the proposed method. As a result, this analytical parameter extraction method provides a robust tool and approach for research and applications in the field of solar cell modeling.}

To evaluate the relative importance of different cognitive processes to OCD, we administered an expanded CSC scale and two state-of-the-art measures of thought appraisals and beliefs. Scores on the CSC scale reliably differentiated OCD patients (n=30), from an anxious comparison group (OAD, n=25) after controlling for scores on the two cognition measures. The tendency to excessively reflect upon one’s cognitive processes may increase opportunities for negative appraisals of intrusive thoughts, foster over-importance of thought beliefs, and increase the likelihood of developing OCD.}

This paper presents an approach using the computational fluid dynamics (CFD)-based simulations to compare the numerical predictions with the original architectural insight for a verification of the architect's thinking in his realization of the design purpose. In the analysis, we consider the incompressible isothermal turbulent airflow to examine the interaction of the flow with the building for a better understanding of the wind-driven self-sustaining ventilation mechanism. We also propose a modified model via enlarging the aeration opening with the least blockages along the wind pathway. The simulated results indicate that the improved design substantially enhances the air-intake effectiveness and realizes a satisfactory pressure balance for the Tjibaou Cultural Center.}

This paper, firstly, presents and discusses a biologically inspired design approach, based on biomimicry thinking (BT). Besides integrating linguistic tools and brainstorming within the BT approach, the importance of a stricter integration with the engineering context is also discussed. Secondly, the paper presents a practical application of this approach: design an innovative and sustainable oilwater separation device. In particular, the application of the proposed approach allowed identifying a bioinspired solution capable to improve the process performances in a device based on a known strategy. More in detail, the adopted bioinspired solution consists of a superoleophobic surface that mimics the microstructure of the filefish scale surface and eases the oilwater separation process by hindering oil drops deposition on some surfaces. The cost and resource effectiveness of the practical realisation of this surface greatly benefited by the latest advancements in the additive manufacturing field.}

In this research, I show that if previous sales prices are round numbers, defined as multiples of £1,000 (e.g. £231,000), subsequent sales prices entail a considerable premium relative to similar properties that were previously priced at charm numbers that are marginally below those round numbers (e.g. £230,999 or £230,950). Using a sample of repeat sales from the Greater London region from 1995 to 2017, I estimate the premium to be approximately 4 percent after controlling for property characteristics and a large set of fixed effects. Increasing public accessibility of information attenuates the effect. Tax considerations, financial constraints, and pricing errors cannot explain the result. I propose a framework of reference dependence and left-digit bias to explain the result, highlighting the presence of behavioural biases in household decisions, even when very high stakes are involved.}

abstract = {Construction material offcuts is a data problem that can largely be avoided by dimensional coordination during concept design. Besides the environmental benefits, early phase coordination is beneficial to the overall design process as it integrates information not typically considered until later in the design process. However, taking reality-changing actions is often challenged by uncertainty, time constraints, and lack of integration of available tools. Acknowledging the potential of computational design in enabling architects to manage design and coordination complexities and taking plasterboard opportunities for dimensional coordination, the paper presents a review and assessment of the existing methods to interrogate what, when, and how are these adaptable to the task. The study shows that ML-based methods outperform other methods and concludes that leveraging computational design powers to reduce offcuts is not a question of a tool, but one of a strategy. Eventually, the future steps to achieving such a strategy are discussed.}

abstract = {The energy, water and food (EWF) nexus modelling and analysis frameworks proposed recently have demonstrated their effectiveness in the assessment and quantification of synergies and trade-offs in the interlinkages between the three sectors. They largely rely on static, deterministic or equilibrium-based models that facilitate in making decisions for well-behaved and predictable resource systems over time. These frameworks, however, are partly limited in their functionality due to the fact that they do not consider the exposure of systems to the dynamic nature of extrinsic uncertainties and the associated risks in the nexus. Hence, there is a need for a sequential learning, planning and optimal control modelling framework which could help achieve adaptive systems under volatile conditions with the objective to maximise economic output and enhance their operational resilience. In this paper, the authors discuss the development of a novel computational framework which incorporates “algorithmic resilience thinking” to achieve adaptive and robust inter-networked systems. Here, the question of adaptive systems for EWF nexus resilience is posed as a reinforcement learning problem based on sequential decision-making called the Markov decision process (MDP). The authors further discuss a case study, considering weather volatility, its spatial impact on vegetation, and the consequent risks on the water-food nexus for outdoor agricultural operations in the State of Qatar. The application of the developed framework particularly demonstrates promise in providing the functionality to track and mitigate emerging risks that have the potential to cause unprecedented disruption in the operations of integrated natural resource systems. The outcome of this study has positive implications for the advancement and effectiveness of EWF nexus planning and risk management to avert resource shortages and price risks, socio-economic disruption, and cascading failures of critical infrastructures, particularly when the global supply chains are subjected to stresses and shocks, such as extreme weather conditions.}

Ten-year-old children are able to devise such programs to rearrange the order of the cars in trains on a simple railway track with a single siding. According to the theory, they rely on kinematic mental models that simulate the required sequence of steps, and we devised a computer program, mAbducer, which does so too in creating its own programs for such rearrangements. An experiment showed that a simple measure of the complexity of its programs, based on Kolmogorov complexity, predicts ten-year-olds’ difficulty in this task: the measure is the number of words in mAbducer’s programs for solving the rearrangement in a minimal number of moves. Complexity, in turn, reflects the structure of the required programs, which need loops of moves to be repeated, and often moves before and after such a loop. Children’s errors are predictable in both their location and nature. Our results therefore have implications for the assessment and pedagogy of computational thinking.}

In general, North American travellers mainly leaned towards analytic thinking, whereas Chinese travellers showcased a blend of holistic and analytic thought processes. The topic of travel, leisure and accommodation showed both holistic and analytic thinking styles. The topics of nature and environment, front desk service, and travel routes and scenic spot areas mainly represented a holistic thinking style. The topics of convenience and facilities, breakfast, transportation, hotel theme and features, and decoration and amenities mainly suggested an analytic thinking style.

Firstly, it determines the role of LCA in the evaluation of energy efficiency and environmental performance of buildings. Secondly, it elaborates LCA of these constructions through the lens of international standards. The methodological approach of the study leads to development of a whole building life cycle formula that sums up the contributions from a set of LCAs. By doing so, the paper highlights the necessity of LCA applications in buildings, and the need for minimisation of resource and energy consumption, and environmental impact. The study helps in better understanding the way LCA supports the search for and identification of innovation pathways in buildings. This paper contributes to the efforts in providing theoretical expansions in LCA of buildings and stimulates the creation of technical standards for the residential building construction sector.}

The proposed BCM implements with the two main steps. First, we combine free energy principle and sparse perception mechanism to achieve the goal of only using extremely few reference for assessing the image quality. Second, we further introduce the attention perception mechanism to boost the assessment performance by improving the sparse perception mechanism mentioned above. Based on the most commonly used image quality database, it was found that our proposed model has derived higher performance than the peer extremely few reference IQA models and competitive performance as compared with the benchmark full reference IQA models.}

Conventional antibiotics no longer offer adequate protection due to the evolution of strategies to evade them. As a result, efforts are needed to design novel replacement antibiotics, making them unique from most other forms of drug development. As drug discovery costs have steadily increased along with the need for novel antibiotics, the interest in antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) as alternative antimicrobial treatments has grown in recent years. As a complement to experimental high-throughput screening, computational methods have become essential in hit and lead discovery in pharmaceutical research. It may be possible to access unexplored chemical space with customized virtual compound libraries. It has been questioned whether screening billions of molecules virtually with the risk of false positives is practical despite their unlimited potential size. In terms of finding novel chemical compounds capable of solving many global problems, machine learning, deep learning, and generative models hold significant promise. It is anticipated that the current challenges and limitations about the applicability of the stated approaches will be overcome in the coming years. However, plenty of advances are still required to achieve their full potential. In this perspective, we review the previous and ongoing work based on the latest scientific breakthroughs and technologies that could offer new opportunities and alternative strategies for developing novel AMPs.}

The contexts include social networks and blogs, political discourse, corporate announcements, digital journalism, mobile telephony, home entertainment, online gaming, financial services, online shopping, social advertising, and social commerce. The changing costs of data collection and the new capabilities that researchers have to conduct research that leverages micro-level, meso-level and macro-level data suggest the possibility of a scientific paradigm shift toward computational social science.

In Finland, a new curriculum for grades 1–9 came into force in 2016 introducing digital competence (including programming) to be integrated in other subjects. Most teachers lack prior experience in programming and there is a need for suitable instructional models. This article presents a cross-curricular teaching sequence and the results from a case study conducted in four Finnish schools. Students in grades 4–6 collaboratively worked on a project combining arts, design and CT with other subjects. The results show that students demonstrated several CT abilities while working on their projects, in particular creativity, tinkering and debugging. The findings also indicate that teachers and students learned together (co-agency) and suggest that models like the teaching sequence can help and encourage teachers to integrate programming and CT in a cross-curricular manner. Still, the teachers’ knowledge, ambition level and understanding of the task at hand, as well as the organizational support appear to play a notable role when planning and carrying out projects of this kind. While CT is commonly seen as developed through programming, the teaching sequence seems to have fostered CT abilities through the project as a whole, with programming playing the role of a tool or a glue depending on the time available, and the students’ skill and ambition level.}

Traditionally, the derivation of Rp involves solving analytical expressions through partial differentiation and integration of generalized thermodynamics equations combined with specific equations of state (EoS). This method is mathematically demanding, increasing cognitive load and often limiting classroom discussions to simpler EoS for which analytical solutions are readily available in textbooks. To enhance student engagement and reduce the time spent on complex derivations, we propose a simplified approach that numerically evaluates Rp using standard software tools. This approach not only minimizes the mathematical effort, allowing students to focus on thermodynamic concepts, but also extends the applicability to more complex EoS that are not covered in textbooks. By significantly reducing the instructional time required for Rp calculations, this method fosters critical thinking, promotes autonomy, and can be applied to other fundamental thermodynamics topics that traditionally rely on analytical expressions, such as multicomponent solution models.}

abstract = {Decision-making in groups is a remarkable and decisive element of human societies. Humans are able to organize themselves in groups, engage in collaborative decision-making processes and arrive at a binding agreement, even in the absence of unanimous consent. However, the transfer of decision-making autonomy requires a willingness to deliberately expose oneself to the decisions of others. A lack of trust in the abilities of others or of the underlying decision-making process, i.e. public trust, can lead to a breakdown of organizations in political or economic domains. Recent studies indicate that the biological basis of trust on an individual level is related to Oxytocin, an endogenous neuropeptide and hormone, which is also associated with pro-social behavior and positive conflict resolution. However, little is known about the effects of Oxytocin on the inclination of individuals to form or join groups and to deliberately engage in collaborative decision-making processes. Here, we show that intranasal administration of Oxytocin (n = 60) compared to placebo (n = 60) in males causes an adverse effect on the choice for forming groups in the presence of a competitive environment. In particular, Oxytocin negatively affects the willingness to work collaboratively in a p-Beauty contest game, whereas the effect is most pronounced for participants with relatively high strategic sophistication. Since our data provide initial evidence that Oxytocin has a positive effect on strategic thinking and performance in the p-Beauty contest game, we argue that the adverse effect on group formation might be rooted in an enhanced strategic sophistication of participants treated with Oxytocin.}

abstract = {ICT solutions have been proposed as a means for changing environmentally unfavourable traffic behaviour by providing better, real-time and more accessible travel information. However, prevailing models of travel choice and travel behaviour tend to overemphasise the impact and importance of information and the individualistic perspective. The issue of choice and travel planning in everyday life situations, and how information is used and acted on in these processes, was examined in a qualitative study in Stockholm, Sweden. Practice Theory was used as the theoretical framework for the study. Interviews were supplemented with an explorative diary and photo assignment to bring unreflected choices and actions of planning travel to the conscious level. The results showed that travel planning involves the immediate situation where planning and decisions are made, but also aspirations, cognitive/time/material limitations, social norms and social relations that extend widely in time and space. Definitions of travel planning and travel information based on the situated practices of planning are suggested. In the muddle of everyday life, travel planning takes place in the brief moments where circumstances at different levels – time, place, the social realm - interact and are considered or directly acted upon. In the development of new ICT-based travel information services, the role of technology in changing normal practices should be considered.}

Less represented in these interdisciplinary efforts is the perspective of cognitive science. We propose a framework – computational ethics – that specifies how the ethical challenges of AI can be partially addressed by incorporating the study of human moral decision-making. The driver of this framework is a computational version of reflective equilibrium (RE), an approach that seeks coherence between considered judgments and governing principles. The framework has two goals: (i) to inform the engineering of ethical AI systems, and (ii) to characterize human moral judgment and decision-making in computational terms. Working jointly towards these two goals will create the opportunity to integrate diverse research questions, bring together multiple academic communities, uncover new interdisciplinary research topics, and shed light on centuries-old philosophical questions.}

PHAST+ incorporates a highly efficient method for calculating accommodation and adaptation, making it particularly suited for simulations over extended stimulus durations. The proposed method uses a leaky integrator inspired by classic biophysical nerve models. Through evaluation against single-fiber animal data, our findings demonstrate the model’s effectiveness across various stimuli, including short pulse trains with variable amplitudes and rates. Notably, the PHAST+ model performs better than its predecessor, PHAST (a phenomenological model by van Gendt et al.), particularly in simulations of prolonged neural responses. While PHAST+ is optimized primarily on spike rate decay, it shows good behavior on several other neural measures, such as vector strength and degree of adaptation. The future implications of this research are promising. PHAST+ drastically reduces the computational burden to allow the real-time simulation of neural behavior over extended periods, opening the door to future simulations of psychophysical experiments and multi-electrode stimuli for evaluating novel speech-coding strategies for cochlear implants.}

Learning in social interactions is critical for bond formation and acquiring knowledge. Importantly, this type of learning is typically bi-directional, as both partners learn about each other simultaneously. Here we review the literature on social learning and propose a new computational and neural model characterizing mutual predictions that take place within and between interactions. According to our model, each partner in the interaction attempts to minimize the prediction error of the self and the interaction partner. In most cases, these inferential models become similar over time, thus enabling mutual understanding to develop. At the neural level, this type of social learning may be supported by interbrain plasticity, defined as a change in interbrain coupling over time in neural networks associated with social learning, among them the mentalizing network, the observation-execution system, and the hippocampus. The mutual prediction model constitutes a promising means of providing empirically verifiable accounts of how relationships develop over time.}

Misophonia is a disorder in which certain sounds produced by other people lead to intense negative reactions. It remains unknown how misophonia relates to other psychiatric conditions or impairments. To identify latent constructs underlying symptoms, we conducted a factor analysis consisting of items from questionnaires assessing symptoms of misophonia and other psychiatric conditions. One thousand forty-two participants completed the questionnaires and a social exchange task in which they either could (“controllable”) or could not (“uncontrollable”) influence future monetary offers from other people. Misophonia and obsessive-compulsive (OC) symptoms loaded onto the same factor. Compared with individuals with low Miso-OC factor scores, individuals with high scores reported higher perceived controllability of their social interactions during the uncontrollable condition and stronger aversion to social norm violations in the uncontrollable compared with the controllable condition. Together, these results suggest misophonia, and OC symptoms share a latent psychiatric dimension characterized by aberrant computations of social controllability.}

Replay in the brain has been viewed as rehearsal or, more recently, as sampling from a transition model. Here, we propose a new hypothesis: that replay is able to implement a form of compositional computation where entities are assembled into relationally bound structures to derive qualitatively new knowledge. This idea builds on recent advances in neuroscience, which indicate that the hippocampus flexibly binds objects to generalizable roles and that replay strings these role-bound objects into compound statements. We suggest experiments to test our hypothesis, and we end by noting the implications for AI systems which lack the human ability to radically generalize past experience to solve new problems.}

In this review, we illustrate recent developments in this area, and outline a roadmap for improved selection inference. We argue (i) that the development and obligatory use of advanced simulation tools is necessary for improved identification of selected loci, (ii) that genomic information from multiple time points will enhance the power of inference, and (iii) that results from experimental evolution should be utilized to better inform population genomic studies.}

However, narratives are a special class of real-world experience, largely defined by their causal connections across time. Much contemporary neuroscience research does not consider this key property. We review behavioral and neuroscientific work that speaks to how causal structure shapes comprehension of and memory for narratives. We further draw connections between this work and reinforcement learning, highlighting how narratives help link causes to outcomes in complex environments. By incorporating the plausibility of causal connections between classes of actions and outcomes, reinforcement learning models may become more ecologically valid, while simultaneously elucidating the value of narratives.}

We analyze in physical terms based on recent results in the foundations of statistical mechanics two well-known (independent) problems that arise for this approach: the problem of multiple-computations and the problem of multiple-realization. We show that within the computational theory of the mind the two problems are insoluble by the physics of the brain. We further show that attempts to solve the problems by the interactions of the systems implementing the computations with an environment (in or outside the brain) must introduce non-physical factors, and therefore fail on physical grounds. We also show that the problems are endemic and pertain to other forms of functional theories of the mind, most notably, causal functionalism. Finally, we propose a physicalist reductive identity theory, which is a generalization of statistical mechanics for all the special sciences, and show that only a theory of this kind can provide physical solutions to the above two problems in computational neuroscience. We conclude that functionalism in the theory of mind must be replaced with a reductive identity theory. This result has far-reaching implications with respect to the research programs in brain science.}

Most participants are blinded by the abundance of digital devices and misled by the hardware and software providers who try to convince and force education systems to keep track of untraceable developments. However, recent studies have revealed that the productivity of the participants and the sustainability of their digital artifacts generate a huge but silent waste, both in terms of human and machine resources. This contradiction generates a paradox in which the illusion of digital prosperity does not allow us to clearly see the ineffectiveness of digital processes and artifacts and the losses piling up. Our research revealed that the methodology of Lean Thinking allows us to find the root causes of the problems and the revolutionary changes which must be applied to eliminate the waste generated by the participants in the digital era. It was also found that the adaptation of the lean philosophy, proven effective in production, services, and administration, can be a solution in resolving the paradox of digital education, which leads us to Lean Digital Education (LDE). Within this framework – instead of the widely accepted tool-centered ideas – we offer a human-centered, long-term thinking philosophy focusing on respect for participants, on their development, tasks, and problems, while at the same time eliminating and reducing waste. The present paper details the strength of this innovative approach which is based on (1) a solid theoretical background (2) a reliable measuring system for calculating the waste of digital activities and artifacts, (3) approaches proven to be effective and efficient in end-user data management, and (4) examples of the learning-teaching materials which support the philosophy adapted.}

Forming self-referential 2nd-order beliefs about what others think you will do seems to be a mixture of processes used to make choices and form beliefs. In equilibrium, there is little difference in neural activity across choice and belief tasks; there is a purely neural definition of equilibrium as a “state of mind.” “Strategic IQ,” actual earnings from choices and accurate beliefs, is negatively correlated with activity in the insula, suggesting poor strategic thinkers are too self-focused, and is positively correlated with ventral striatal activity (suggesting that high IQ subjects are spending more mental energy predicting rewards).}

abstract = {Physiological studies have shown that a group of locust’s lobula giant movement detectors (LGMDs) has a diversity of collision selectivity to approaching objects, relatively darker or brighter than their backgrounds in cluttered environments. Such diversity of collision selectivity can serve locusts to escape from attack by natural enemies, and migrate in swarm free of collision. For computational studies, endeavours have been made to realize the diverse selectivity which, however, is still one of the most challenging tasks especially in complex and dynamic real world scenarios. The existing models are mainly formulated as multi-layered neural networks with merely feed-forward information processing, and do not take into account the effect of re-entrant signals in feedback loop, which is an essential regulatory loop for motion perception, yet never been explored in looming perception. In this paper, we inaugurate feedback neural computation for constructing a new LGMD-based model, named F-LGMD to look into the efficacy upon implementing different collision selectivity. Accordingly, the proposed neural network model features both feed-forward processing and feedback loop. The feedback control propagates output signals of parallel ON/OFF channels back into their starting neurons, thus makes part of the feed-forward neural network, i.e. the ON/OFF channels and the feedback loop form an iterative cycle system. Moreover, the feedback control is instantaneous, which leads to the existence of a fixed point whereby the fixed point theorem is applied to rigorously derive valid range of feedback coefficients. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct systematic experiments covering synthetic and natural collision datasets, and also online robotic tests. The experimental results show that the F-LGMD, with a unified network, can fulfil the diverse collision selectivity revealed in physiology, which not only reduces considerably the handcrafted parameters compared to previous studies, but also offers a both efficient and robust scheme for collision perception through feedback neural computation.}

abstract = {The temporo-mandibular joint is a characteristic feature of mammalian development, and essential to mastication and speech, yet it causes more problems than any other joint in the body and remains the least understood. While it is generally accepted that the normal joint is loaded under compression, the problems and controversies surrounding this view remain unresolved and the disparity in opinion over its treatment continues. Although difficulties in the acquisition of reliable information have undoubtedly contributed to this situation, it is now considered that deficits in neural control and shortcomings in the underlying biomechanical theory and analysis have also played a part, and that a re-assessment from a different perspective could resolve these. Biotensegrity considers the TMJ from this position, where the mandible is suspended within a tensioned network that extends over a much wider anatomical field than is generally recognized and significant motion control is contained within the structure itself. It is an evolutionary-conserved arrangement that enables the system to rapidly respond to changing functional demands and provides a more complete model of joint physiology that can be used to guide further research.}

abstract = {Background
Construction and nursing are critical industries. Although both careers involve physically and mentally demanding work, the risks to workers during the COVID-19 pandemic are not well understood. Nurses (both younger and older) are more likely to experience the ill effects of burnout and stress than construction workers, likely due to accelerated work demands and increased pressure on nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, we analyzed a large social media data set using advanced natural language processing techniques to explore indicators of the mental status of workers across both industries before and during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Objective
This social media analysis aims to fill a knowledge gap by comparing the tweets of younger and older construction workers and nurses to obtain insights into any potential risks to their mental health due to work health and safety issues.
Methods
We analyzed 1,505,638 tweets published on Twitter (subsequently rebranded as X) by younger and older (aged <45 vs >45 years) construction workers and nurses. The study period spanned 54 months, from January 2018 to June 2022, which equates to approximately 27 months before and 27 months after the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic on March 11, 2020. The tweets were analyzed using big data analytics and computational linguistic analyses.
Results
Text analyses revealed that nurses made greater use of hashtags and keywords (both monograms and bigrams) associated with burnout, health issues, and mental health compared to construction workers. The COVID-19 pandemic had a pronounced effect on nurses’ tweets, and this was especially noticeable in younger nurses. Tweets about health and well-being contained more first-person singular pronouns and affect words, and health-related tweets contained more affect words. Sentiment analyses revealed that, overall, nurses had a higher proportion of positive sentiment in their tweets than construction workers. However, this changed markedly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Since early 2020, sentiment switched, and negative sentiment dominated the tweets of nurses. No such crossover was observed in the tweets of construction workers.
Conclusions
The social media analysis revealed that younger nurses had language use patterns consistent with someone experiencing the ill effects of burnout and stress. Older construction workers had more negative sentiments than younger workers, who were more focused on communicating about social and recreational activities rather than work matters. More broadly, these findings demonstrate the utility of large data sets enabled by social media to understand the well-being of target populations, especially during times of rapid societal change.}

abstract = {Background
Formal Thought Disorder and includes both positive (i.e., disorganized speech) and negative (i.e., impoverished speech) symptoms. Emerging evidence suggests that the cerebellum plays a critical role in cognitive functions, including language processing. This study leverages Natural Language Processing to objectively measure language disturbances in patients with first-episode psychosis and investigates the relationship between these disturbances and cerebellar structure.
Methods
Fifty-four patients with schizophrenia, either drug-naïve or minimally medicated, were recruited from an early psychosis program. Impoverished thought was assessed using the Thought Language Index while lexico-semantic features (affect, cognitive, linguistic, perception, time) were identified from speech samples analyzed using the Linguistic Inquiry Word Count-22 software. Structural cerebellar analysis was completed on 7.0 Tesla MRI scans using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) to measure global and regional grey matter volume changes.
Results
Linear regression analysis revealed that reduced perceptual word usage was the strongest predictor of impoverished thinking. Correlational analysis identified reduced cerebellar volumes in patients with lower LIWC-based perception scores. VBM localized this relationship to a cluster in the right posterolateral cerebellar hemisphere, an area related to executive demand and verb generation function.
Conclusion
The cerebellum contributes to impoverished thinking in early psychosis, likely by influencing the lexical expression of perceptual experiences. This underscores the cerebellum's role in higher-order cognitive processes relevant to psychotic disorders and its potential as a therapeutic target for language and cognitive deficits in schizophrenia.}

However, owing to the exponential growth of patients and health information, manual analysis of abnormalities in medical information has become increasingly difficult for doctors. Computational intelligence approaches can be employed to address this issue. Machine learning and deep learning play crucial roles in identifying anomalies in healthcare information. Machine learning for anomaly detection plays an essential role in recognizing unexpected patterns or outliers in the data. Anomaly detection is an active research subject. This is important in areas such as information security, banking, medical care, and industrial monitoring. Anomaly detection is an important aspect of healthcare analytics. In reality, abnormal occurrences must be accurately identified with few false negative alarms, even when operating with high-noise data. This study aims to provide comprehensive information on different machine and deep learning models and their efficient utilization in detecting anomalies in health-related records. Furthermore, this chapter will analyze anomaly detection methods for significant diseases, such as cancer, diabetes, and lung-related diseases. Finally, we discuss the benefits and limitations of popular anomaly detection methods and, explore recent trends in anomaly detection.}

Now, biological research enters a new era when experiment and theory walk hand in hand. Novel software and specialized hardware became essential to understand experimental data and propose new models. In fact, current petascale computing resources already allow researchers to reach unprecedented levels of simulation throughput to connect in silico and in vitro experiments. The reduction in cost and improved access allowed a large number of research groups to adopt supercomputing resources and techniques. Here, we outline how large-scale computing has evolved to expand decades-old research, spark new research efforts, and continuously connect simulation and observation. For instance, multiple publicly and privately funded groups have dedicated extensive resources to develop artificial intelligence tools for computational biophysics, from accelerating quantum chemistry calculations to proposing protein structure models. Moreover, advances in computer hardware have accelerated data processing from single-molecule experimental observations and simulations of chemical reactions occurring throughout entire cells. The combination of software and hardware has opened the way for exascale computing and the production of the first public exascale supercomputer, Frontier, inaugurated by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in 2022. Ultimately, the popularization and development of computational techniques and the training of researchers to use them will only accelerate the diversification of tools and learning resources for future generations.}

We outline how this social learning framework can help specify and quantify social psychopathology across disorders and provide an overview of the brain regions that may be involved in this type of social learning. We highlight how this framework can specify commonalities and differences in the social psychopathology of individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), personality disorders (PD), and major depressive disorder (MDD) and improve treatments on an individual basis. We conjecture that individuals with psychiatric disorders rely on rigid social knowledge representations when learning about others, albeit the nature of their rigidity and the behavioral consequences can greatly differ. While non-clinical cohorts tend to efficiently adapt social knowledge representations to relevant environmental constraints, psychiatric cohorts may rigidly stick to their preconceived notions or overly coarse knowledge representations during learning.}

We address this issue by proposing that neuroticism stems from trait individual differences in activity in brain circuits that govern the nature of self-generated thought (SGT). We argue our theory explains not only the association of neuroticism with threat sensitivity but also the prominence within the neurotic mind of representations of information that are unrelated to the way the world is right now, such as creativity and nonsituational ‘angst’.}

We defend, however, that cognition and computation are in action, thus cognition is just a form of computing and that cognition is the explanatory basis for computation. We state that: 1. Representational theories of computing recurring to intentional content run into metaphysical problems. 2. Functional non-representational theories do not incur this metaphysical problem when describing computing in terms of the abstract machine. 3. Functional theories are consistent with enactive in describing computing machines not in a strictly functional way, but especially in terms of their organization. 4. Enactive cognition is consistent with the computationalism in describing Turing machines as functionally and organizationally closed systems. 5. The cognitive explanatory basis for computing improves the computational theory of cognition. When developed in the human linguistic domain, computer science is seen as a product of human socionatural normative practices, however, cognition is just an explanatory, not ontological, basis for computing. The paper concludes by supporting that computation is in action, that cognition is just one form of computing in the world and the explanatory basis for computation.}

An applicative approach is systematically applied to build a concept-as-process design. Since modern computing considers information processes as the main objects of modeling, the developed design is indeed representative of the semantic processing of information. The nature of concepts – what concepts are – and the constraints that govern the theory of concepts have been, and continue to be, the subject of debate. It is especially interesting to discuss the nature of concepts in connection with the recently established fundamental nature of information processes that are attributable to all phenomena and events occurring in the world around us. The current trend elevates information processes to forms of computing, which can also be implemented through practices, for example, in the form of programming. The deep component is computational models, one way or another expressed by means of mathematics and metamathematics. The main meta-operations used are abstraction and application. Of greatest interest is functional abstraction and application in the form of applying a function to an argument. Despite this “conceptual minimalism”, a rich theory of concepts can be developed. Using this theory, it is possible to focus further discussion not only on the nature of concepts, but also to characterize the position on each of the five important issues that are central to many theories of concepts: (1) ontology of concepts, (2) structure of concepts, (3) empiricism, and nativism about concepts, (4) concepts and natural language, and (5) concepts and conceptual analysis.}

There were four key findings: (1) children with DLD exhibited poorer mathematical knowledge than typically-developing children, both in calculation and on key math concepts, (2) children with DLD performed similarly to typically-developing children on the visual pattern extension task, (3) children with DLD had lower verbal working memory scores than typically-developing children, and these differences in working memory accounted in part for their poorer calculation performance, and (4) children’s pattern extension scores predicted their arithmetic calculation scores, but not their concept scores.}

Confusion matrices were used to establish the performance of the AI by comparing AI predictions to human analysis on a validation set of data. The findings suggested that the AI classified several aspects of children's CT in a way that was highly consistent with human analysis, demonstrating how the AI could serve as an additional team member during multimodal analysis.

abstract = {Computational intelligence (CI) has the potential to help tackle some of the world's most challenging social problems. Real-life examples of AI are already being applied in about one-third of these use cases They range from diagnosing cancer to helping blind people navigate their surroundings, identifying victims of online sexual exploitation, and aiding disaster-relief efforts etc. AI is only part of a much broader tool kit of measures that can be used to tackle societal issues, however. For now, issues such as data accessibility and shortages of AI talent constrain its application for social good. This chapter has grouped use cases into 10 social-impact domains based on taxonomies in use among social-sector organizations. Each use case highlights a type of meaningful problem that can be solved by one or more AI capability. The cost of human suffering, and the value of alleviating it, are impossible to gauge and compare. Nonetheless, employing usage frequency as a proxy, we measure the potential impact of different AI capabilities.}

Framed in 2015 to extend the purpose of Zadeh's Z-numbers, a Z*-number is a perceptual symbol of the meaning of a natural language expression and consequently mentalese – or internal speech. This article, through decomposition of the Z*-macro-parameters into its atomic constituents, presents a model for the endogenous arousal of thoughts during empathetic, bespoke comprehension of the real-world. Based on Minsky's Society of Mind, the framework is founded on the assimilation of multimodal experiences, a sense of ‘unified self’ and its derivatives (choice, interest, curiosity, etc.), objective and subjective components of knowledge, commonsense, and attention dynamics over a real-world scenario. The model attempts emulation of slow and fast thinking, instinctive reactions, learning, deliberation, reflection and self-conscious decisions. The design has been validated against human responses, and aims to contribute to the development of autonomous artificial systems for man-machine symbiosis.}

The brains and minds of our human ancestors remain inaccessible for experimental exploration. Therefore, we reconstructed human cognitive evolution by projecting nonsynonymous/synonymous rate ratios (ω values) in mammalian phylogeny onto the anatomically modern human (AMH) brain. This atlas retraces human neurogenetic selection and allows imputation of ancestral evolution in task-related functional networks (FNs). Adaptive evolution (high ω values) is associated with excitatory neurons and synaptic function. It shifted from FNs for motor control in anthropoid ancestry (60–41 mya) to attention in ancient hominoids (26–19 mya) and hominids (19–7.4 mya). Selection in FNs for language emerged with an early hominin ancestor (7.4–1.7 mya) and was later accompanied by adaptive evolution in FNs for strategic thinking during recent (0.8 mya–present) speciation of AMHs. This pattern mirrors increasingly complex cognitive demands and suggests that co-selection for language alongside strategic thinking may have separated AMHs from their archaic Denisovan and Neanderthal relatives.}

Neural networks, simulated annealing, cultural algorithms, ant colony optimization, and evolutionary algorithms are several instances where psychological, physical, and biological theories have influenced the development of computational methods for problem solving. This chapter takes simulation from the social sciences and shows how it can be modified slightly to perform combinatorial optimization. It explains that thinking is a social activity; human culture and cognition are aspects of a single process. A recent simulation of the spread of culture provides insights into the effects of social interaction and gives a starting point for demonstrating that a small number of simple principles can cause an artificial system to behave remarkably like a complex human society. Though all interactions are local, insights and innovations are transported by culture from the originator to distant individuals; moreover, a combination of various innovations results in more improved methods.}

Independently, by 1950, ethologists such as Tinbergen and Lorenz also began to implicitly embed rudimentary forms of state-dependent computation to create qualitative models of internal drives and naturally occurring animal behaviors. Here, we reformulate core ethological concepts in explicitly dynamical systems terms for stateful computation. We examine, based on a wealth of recent neural data collected during complex innate behaviors across species, the neural dynamics that determine the temporal structure of internal states. We will also discuss the degree to which the brain can be hierarchically partitioned into nested dynamical systems and the need for a multi-dimensional state-space model of the neuromodulatory system that underlies motivational and affective states.}

These social dependencies make it difficult to formalize social learning problems in a mathematically tractable way. While it is tempting to dispense with these complexities, they are a defining feature of social life. Because the structure of social interactions challenges the simplifying assumptions often made in models, they make an ideal testbed for computational models of cognition. By adopting a framework that embeds existing social knowledge into the model, we can go beyond explaining behaviors in laboratory tasks to explaining those observed in the wild.}

abstract = {Given the large amount of time we spend indoors, designing and operating buildings that are safe, comfortable, and conducive to productivity and well-being is essential. To achieve this goal, in the past decades, research has been conducted to investigate the influence of the indoor environment on occupants. Thermal comfort has been the subject of most investigations in this field. However, despite being a consolidated research topic since the 1920s, statistical practices for analysing thermal comfort data often rely on simplified premises, which may be due to several possible factors (e.g., limited computational capabilities and lack of training). Consequently, important aspects of data analysis are often absent or overlooked. Recent statistics and statistical software advances have provided more options for effectively modelling complex issues. However, properly using these tools requires a solid understanding of statistical analysis, increasing the risk of misuse in practice. This paper presents ten questions highlighting the most critical issues regarding statistical analysis for thermal comfort research and practice. The first four questions provide general perspectives concerning statistical data analysis, while the remaining ones address specific problems related to thermal comfort research, but that can extend to all human-centric research in the built environment. Additionally, the last five questions demonstrate the practical significance of analysis pitfalls (i.e., sampling variability, selection bias, variable selection, clustered/nested observations, and measurement error) through examples with synthetic data. This study provides insights into the current statistical ‘habits’ in thermal comfort research and, more importantly, help researchers better define and conduct their statistical analyses.}

Central retinal vessels (CRVs) oriented asymmetrically in the ONH are the single blood supply source to the retina and are believed to act as mechanically stable elements in the ONH in response to intraocular pressure (IOP). However, these mechanical effects are considered negligible in ONH biomechanical studies and received less attention. This study investigated the effects of CRVs on ONH biomechanics taking into consideration three-dimensional asymmetric CRV geometries. A CRV geometry was constructed based on CRV centerlines extracted from optical coherence tomography ONH images in eight healthy subjects and superimposed in the idealized ONH geometry established in previous studies. Mechanical analyses of the ONH in response to the IOP were conducted in the cases with and without CRVs for comparison. Obtained results demonstrated that the CRVs induced anisotropic ONH deformation, particularly in the lamina cribrosa and the associated upper neural tissues (prelamina) with wide ranges of spatial strain distributions. These results indicated that the CRVs result in anisotropic deformation with local strain concentration, rather than function to mechanically support in response to the IOP as in the conventional thinking in ophthalmology.}

In this article, we propose six analytical categories to describe qualitative information regarding imaginations about the collective futures. These categories reflect a conceptual integration of normative stances in Science, Technology and Society and capacity approaches to Futures Studies. We translated those analytical categories into grammatical markers that allow for their operationalisation. Using a large-scale participatory process in Chile aimed at systematising images of the future, we utilised Natural Language Process to transform the grammatical markers into computational codes that allowed us to automatically assess large amounts of qualitative data. Ultimately, our main argument is that analytical categories to describe imaginations about collective futures can be generated with reasonable foundations in the humanities and social sciences.}

Three distinct and widely used features – Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), Local Binary Patterns (LBP), and Principal components (PCs) extracted from target images are used in a manner which is simple, and yet effective. The HOG and LBP features further undergo Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction. Our model uses multi-layer perceptrons (MLP) to classify these three features and fuse them to form a sparsely connected model. A computational theory is first developed by using concepts from the information processing mechanism of the brain. Extensive experiments are carried out using eight publicly available face datasets to validate our proposed model’s performance in recognizing faces with extreme variation of illumination, pose angle, expression, and background. We also investigate the same mechanism because of reasons discussed later, on object recognition tasks as well. Results obtained are extremely promising when compared with other face and object recognition algorithms including CNN and deep learning-based methods. This highlights that simple computational processes, if clubbed properly, can produce competing performance with best algorithms.}

To this aim, we engage with contributions to socio-metabolic studies, notably from social ecology, that are not directly concerned with the urban dimension but explicitly question how systems and actors shape each other and how social practices can influence the distribution of resource flows and stocks and their interdependencies. Based on those contributions, we identify three critical axes of investigation that help track implicit uses of the concept of “agency” in urban metabolism studies and constitute the pillars of our proposed framework: (1) characterizing structures comprising urban social-ecological systems – understood as patterns of connections among elements and subsystems – as actors, (2) identifying the chains of events that such actors influence by exerting their agentic capacities, and (3) associating those same actors with definite agentic dimensions, i.e., specific modalities of agency. By drawing on methods from computational linguistics, text mining, and semantic network analysis, we extract concepts cognate to “urban metabolism” from a relevant body of research literature. Through our framework, we show how such concepts define forms of agency that can be ascribed to structural components of urban social-ecological systems.}

The current study attempts to address this gap by developing and demonstrating an assessment procedure to evaluate the extent of lean implementation in a healthcare institution To begin with, different lean tenets and elements applied in healthcare institutions were identified through a literature review. Following it, a Fuzzy-Logic Input Based Healthcare Institution Lean Implementation Assessment (FLB-HLIA) was developed and deployed in an Indian case hospital to compute “Healthcare Institution’s Lean Implementation Index” (HLII). FLB-HLIA revealed that the case hospital has to focus on two lean tenets, namely establishing pull system, and seeking perfection, to improve its HLII. Assessment also revealed the lean elements that the case hospital can focus to upgrade its HLII. HLII can be used by practitioners to perform intra-benchmarking and inter-benchmarking of healthcare institutions. Results of FLB-HLIA provide a future action plan for the lean implementation journey of the healthcare institution by identifying the possible areas of improvement for future.}

Concurrently, calls for integrating CT concepts within authentic science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) contexts have also increased. This is reflected by the inclusion of CT in the Next Generation Science Standards and the Standards for Technological and Engineering Literacy. However, methods for teaching CT concepts within secondary level STEM courses vary drastically. Physical computing, the design and programming of physical systems or devices using computational thinking skills, has become increasingly popular in the U.S. in attempts to integrate CT within authentic STEM problem-solving contexts. Despite this rise in popularity, there remains a limited but growing body of research investigating physical computing pedagogy and student learning. A mixed methods design was used in this study to examine 170 middle school students’ attitudes toward coding and after participating in either a screen-based or physical computing unit. The results indicated that students who completed the screen-based unit reported statistically greater attitudes toward the classroom applications and career/future use of computing concepts. Students in the treatment group believed that physical computing made learning computing concepts more difficult, but they preferred the hands-on learning opportunities provided by physical computing. Furthermore, male students reported higher attitudinal ratings than females regarding the influence computing would have on their future academic and career choices. This study provides implications for improving physical computing instruction and integration within STEM education contexts.}

While such integrative curricula are expected in a graduate school setting, they are challenging at the undergraduate level since they require proficiency in multiple disciplines. However, making this transition to interdisciplinary, project-based teaching at the undergraduate level gives a competitive edge to undergraduates. As part of a broader effort of developing a comprehensive neuroscience curriculum, we implemented an interdisciplinary, one-semester, upper-level course called Biophysical Modeling of Excitable Cells (BMEC). The course exposes undergraduate students to broad areas of computational biology. It focuses on computational neuroscience, develops scientific literacy, and promotes teamwork between biology, psychology, physics, and mathematics-oriented undergraduates. This course also provides pedagogical experience for senior Ph.D. students in Neuroscience. BMEC is a three contact hours per week lecture-based course that includes a set of computer-based activities designed to gradually increase the undergraduates’ ability to apply mathematics and computational concepts to solving biologically-relevant problems. The class brings together two different groups of students with very dissimilar and complementary backgrounds, i.e., biology/psychology and physics/mathematics oriented. The teamwork allows students with more substantial biology/psychology backgrounds to explain to physics/mathematics students the biological implications and instill realism into the computer modeling project they completed for this class. Simultaneously, students with substantial physics/mathematics backgrounds can apply techniques learned in specialized mathematics, physics, or computer science classes to generate mathematical hypotheses and implement them in computer codes. This study expands on Oprisan (2021) by including examples of hands-on activities, student projects, and a brief overview of course assessment tools and results.

abstract = {Emergence has been widely recognized as a significant phenomenon of visual reasoning in design. Despite its centrality as a cognitive phenomenon, research in emergence currently lacks a comprehensive theoretical foundation. A broadened view of design emergence that adds to the perceptual phenomenon of shape emergence in reflecting the way the design domains are conceptualized is proposed. An expanded theory of emergence in which visual cognition plays an important role is presented. Beginning with an attempt to broaden the perceptual perspectives of shape emergence, the process of cognitive emergence is defined. The duality of related perceptual and cognitive components provides a working basis for conceptualizing visual emergence in design. Antithetical to the idea of accidental emergence, it is proposed that emergence is guided and anticipated. We claim that it is the re-cognition of visual shapes and images in design that enables emergence. This kind of guidance function in emergence is termed ‘anticipated emergence’. We demonstrate how high-level domain knowledge of visual forms can be accommodated as cognitive content, and how this can contribute to establishing a cognitive basis for emergence. An empirical experiment from the domain of architecture is presented.}

abstract = {Nowadays, more and more multimedia services are supported by Mobile Edge Computing (MEC). However, the instability of the wireless environment brings a lot of uncertainty to the computational offloading. Additionally, intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is considered as a potential technology to enhance Quality of Service (QoS). Therefore, in this paper, we establish a framework for IRS-assisted MEC computational offloading to solve this problem and take fairness optimization as a key point involving communication and computing resources. Minimize user consumption by optimizing bandwidth allocation, task offloading ratio, edge computing resources, transmission power and IRS phase shifts. Firstly, we decompose the problem into three aspects, such as bandwidth allocation, computing resource allocation, transmission power and IRS phase shifts. Then, an alternative optimization algorithm is proposed to find the optimum solution and its convergence is proved. Secondly, since the optimization problem on transmission power and IRS phase shifts is non-convex, we propose Riemann gradient descent (R-SGD) algorithm to solve it. Finally, numerical results show that our proposed algorithm performs better than other algorithms and achieves a superiority in the framework.}

abstract = {Technological interoperability is a driver for seamless data and information exchange between project team members in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry. It is defined as the ability of different systems to exchange information with minimum loss. Therefore, interoperability lack is often a barrier in modern construction applications, such as robotics. Construction and robotics, seen from their respective areas, are highly divergent in context, organization, procedures, and technologies. However, both paradigms use computation, which gives computational systems the potential to enable construction robotics. This research is based on the Design Science Research (DSR) methodology and aims to develop a framework for operationalizing industrial robots in construction. To this end, it uses Computational Design (CD) driven by Building Information Modeling (BIM) for Robotic Manufacturing (RM) within Off-Site Construction (OSC) systems. This technological alignment allowed the development of an integrated Design-to-Manufacturing (DtM) framework, validated by 16 evaluators.}

abstract = {Building information modeling (BIM) and sustainable building certification integration have been the focus of several studies in recent years, aiming to create a simpler and more effective building certification process. This paper describes a novel computational tool for architects and engineers, considering that the certification process takes place in a work environment that is familiar to them. The goal is to present a method for developing a computational tool that will automate the process of verifying the achievement of certain Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) credits using visual programming in a BIM environment. In this way, designers can have an insight into the achievement of certain LEED credits at any phase during the design process. Considering the complexity of the digital parameterization of LEED credits, this method includes the achievement of three credits listed in the Material and Resources chapter of the LEED for Building Design and Construction protocol. Apart from similar research, the presented tool enables visibility of real-time LEED credits achievement at every moment of the design, from the building concept development to the final stage. The presented method creates space for the elaboration on the other LEED credits, as well as research in the area of applicability to other green rating certification programs and evaluation of existing building stock.}

abstract = {A content analysis of interviews with an ethnically diverse group of 202 children aged 6 to 10 describes what children think racism is, and examines associations between age, ethnicity, and children's thinking about racism. Children's narratives capture many dimensions of racism, including stereotypes, prejudice, discrimination, and ethnic conflict. With age, children's ideas about racism become more elaborated and differentiated. At every age, compared to their peers, African American children have more elaborated and differentiated ideas about racism and mention those dimensions of racism that overtly reflect power relations more frequently. Qualitative analyses suggest that children's ideas about racism are abstract, increasingly coherent with age, and sometimes incorporate causal language. Findings are discussed in terms of origins of individual differences, the extent to which children's ideas about racism might be considered a lay theory, and the likely consequences of such a theory in daily life.}

Such modules facilitate the study of biological processes by deconstructing complex biological networks into conceptually simple entities. The definition of network modules is often based on intuitive reasoning. As an alternative, methods are being developed for defining biochemical network modules in an unbiased fashion. These unbiased network modules are mathematically derived from the structure of the whole network under consideration.}
