abstract = {In this poster, we describe efforts to assess computational thinking activities that can be easily implemented in any science classroom. Studies have shown that a set of conditions must be met for computational thinking tools to be used in K-12 education and that when they are used, there is a wide spectrum in the level of computational thinking that the tool enables. This study extends this work by examining how middle school students translated their science fair projects into Scratch and what evidence of computational thinking is present. Scrape, a tool designed to analyze Scratch projects was used. Overall, it was found that most students simply created a presentation of their project without much complexity. Eight students created interactive projects that required user participation and used more advanced computational concepts. Finally, recommendations are given for next steps in the creation of a series of activities that would scaffold student learning as they apply to computational thinking concepts of a science concept.},

abstract = {Computational Thinking (CT) has been widely introduced and investigated in recent years, particularly in the U.S. since the born of visual, block-based, drag-drop programming environments such as Kodu, Scratch, Minecraft and App Inventor. Although the user interface is mainly in English, the characteristics of these easy-to-use, game-based, and interactive tools attract many teachers and researchers in the world to pay much attention to the possibilities and opportunities of introducing these tools to students. Recently, some primary school teachers in Hong Kong begin to independently introduce some of these programming tools to students at age 7 - 11 as a part of learning activities in their computer lessons. Their motives are similar but not the same, such as making a fun learning and teaching experience, motivating students for active and collaborative participation, and introducing CT concepts to develop generic skills (e.g. problem solving skills, creativity, and critical thinking). However, there is an absence of well-developed and planned curriculum for "coding education" to introduce computational thinking systematically to students in the local context with expected learning outcomes. Due to the uniqueness of K-12 curriculum in Hong Kong, the existing curriculum model in the U.S. may need to be customized and redesigned to become suitable for integrating into the curriculum in Hong Kong. In this poster, it describes the first proposed coding education curriculum in Hong Kong primary education (Primary 4 to Primary 6) with relevant objectives, structures, contents, and learning outcomes. A new pedagogical design framework for CT is introduced in this poster, which could be generalizable and yet to be evaluated. This new curriculum will serve as the curriculum guide to local teachers, and is the first research initiative of a three-year longitudinal study investigating the impact of CT activities to students particularly in Hong Kong. The experience of this curriculum development for CT concepts in K-12 education can inspire teachers and researchers in other parts of the world when adopting and internationalizing CT activities based on the curriculum model developed under the U.S. education.},

TuneScope combines a sound analysis \&amp; synthesis tool with Snap!, a computing language developed at the University of California, Berkeley. This demo explores CT concepts such as decomposition, patterns, abstraction, and algorithms in TuneScope while also exploring the creation of four cascading musical components from (1) sequences of notes, (2) musical chords, (3) sampled sounds, and (4) synthesized sounds. The challenge is to design activities that include authentic music learning as well as genuine computational thinking. In this demo, we show concepts around sequence (the order in which musical notes appear in time; and the order of statements in a computer program) and repetition (includes repeats as well as the structure of melodies; and computing loops and recursion). The instructional activities in this demo have been piloted three times in an associated course at the University of Virginia. Data collected from the course suggest a positive effect on both the understanding of CT concepts and the comprehension of music.

abstract = {The number of undergraduates entering computer science has declined in recent years. This is paralleled by a drop in the number of high school students taking the CS AP exam and the number of high schools offering computer science courses. The declines come at a time when career opportunities in CS continue to grow and computer science graduates are seen as crucial in building a globally competitive workforce for the 21st century. Efforts aimed at reversing the declining interest in computer science include curriculum revisions at the undergraduate level at many institutions, a re-design of computer science AP courses [1], and the inclusion of computational thinking into disciplines outside computer science [3].This panel discusses four projects of computer science researchers collaborating with high school teachers on integrating computing and computational thinking into their courses. The majority of the high school teachers involved is teaching science and math courses. They are teaching a diverse group of talented and college-bound students. The goal of all projects is to integrate computing into disciplines represented in the high school curriculum and to raise the awareness of computer science as an exciting and intellectually rewarding field.This panel will outline recent and on-going activities and interaction with high school teachers. Each panelist will describe how he/she got involved and the nature of the interaction. The panelists will talk about their individual projects, outline their visions for future interactions, and how their effort can be replicated by others. The session will briefly describe NSF's RET program which provided teacher support for three of the four projects. The session will then be opened for discussion; the audience will be encouraged to ask questions and contribute additional ideas for the inclusion of computational thinking in high school courses.},

abstract = {This paper explores the integration of coding, CT and literacy by describing a study conducted with first and second grade classrooms in Norfolk, Virginia. A total of 667 students and 57 educators from eight elementary schools, as well as 181 students from two comparison schools participated in a curriculum called Coding as Another Language (CAL) that utilizes KIBO robotics, a developmentally appropriate kit which does not require keyboards or screens. CAL positions the teaching of programming as a symbolic system of representation, a tool for creative expression and communication. Thus, research questions regarding the relationship between students' coding and CT outcomes and their literacy skills were explored, as well as teachers' reactions to the experience, in particular regarding the integrating of teaching computer science and literacy in the early grades. Participation in the CAL-KIBO curriculum was associated with improvement in coding and unplugged CT skills. Baseline literacy skills were related to students' acquisition of CT skills. For example, students who had higher literacy scores at the beginning of the term were more successful in CT tasks. Furthermore, although teachers varied in their perceptions of integrating coding and CT with literacy, our findings suggest that these disciplines may share some cognitive and pedagogical overlap that has yet to be extensively explored in the early computing education field.},

This can potentially lead to a deeper understanding of programming, bringing students closer to true computational thinking. Some novel strategies for teaching with Kodu are outlined.

abstract = {This panel consists of faculty who jointly worked on a collaborative project connected to an NSF-sponsored interdisciplinary initiative called "Piloting Pathways for Computational Thinking in the Curriculum." Faculty at Towson University from Computer Science, English, Kinesiology, Music, and Sociology jointly formulated courses that involved applying and connecting ideas for analytic and creative purposes across fields. We respectively experimented with identifying concepts and with using these tools in our respective areas or fields; we also worked towards identifying what aspects or features of computational thinking might be generalized for broader educational purposes. The courses included "Everyday Computational Thinking" (Computer Science), "Revolutionary Networks" (Sociology), "Creative Work with Audio and Visual" (Music), "Computational Thinking in the Humanities" (English), and "Developing Life Skills for Weight Management" (Kinesiology). From the perspective of the humanities and music, much was learned by way of the limits of computation as an explanatory model for the expressive dimensions of our fields; that said, much was also learned about how the constraints it presented could enhance and generate new possibilities for analysis and creativity. The more quantitative-based disciplines likewise explored some applications of computational thinking for more dynamic approaches to problem-solving in everyday contexts and lives. The panel will include several faculty involved in the project who will share their experiences and learning outcomes in brief (approximately 10-minute "flash" presentations with lots of handouts), and we will invite audience inquiries about the challenges experienced in collaborating for such an interdisciplinary project and how what we learned will inform future goals and initiatives.},

Wing argued that computational thinking expresses the importance of computer science to general education, and provides a basis for interdisciplinary collaboration, by setting out the conceptual foundations of computational modeling and reasoning.In this talk, I want to reflect on alternative ways of approaching computational thinking as a site of disciplinary encounter, with a particular focus on the ways that interdisciplinary work might be generative of new forms of computational thinking. This work grows out of a collaboration with colleagues in Australia, whose research is focused on the use of information technology in the cultural practices of indigenous Australian groups, particularly the Yolngu of Northeast Arnhemland. Yolngu epistemology provides an interesting starting point for reconsidering aspects of computational practice, which suggests new perspectives on computational thinking and its practice, and on the possible relationship between computer science and other disciplines.},

Outcomes indicate that we were able to develop positive attitudes about computational thinking and programming among students and teachers who did not necessarily view themselves as “math types.” By partnering with language arts, technology and math teachers at Fisher Middle School, Ewing New Jersey, we introduced the isomorphism between the journalistic process and computational thinking to 7th and 8th graders. An intense summer institute, first with the teachers and then with students recruited from the school, immersed them in the “newsroom of the future” where they researched and wrote news stories, shot and edited video, and developed procedural animations in Scratch to support their storylines. An afterschool club sustained the experience. The teachers adapted interactive journalism and Scratch programming to enrich standard language arts curriculum and are infusing computational thinking in classroom experiences throughout the school.},

With it, teachers and learners can follow different threads of conversation about (multiple representations of) game elements and relations between them. We present a qualitative evaluation study of PoliFacets with two experienced AgentSheets instructors and three school teachers trained to coach students in CTA programs.

abstract = {There is a growing need to develop courses that demonstrate the articulations between computer science and an array of computing-dependent fields. This hands-on workshop will introduce participants to a model for students and faculty to collaborate across disciplines and with a community organization to develop computational solutions to address complex real-world problems. The strength of this model lies in leveraging existing courses and courseware rather developing new ones. Participants will learn how to develop at their own institutions, similar collaborations that involve computer science, a computing-dependent discipline and a community partner. We will provide access to materials that participants can adapt for their own courses to redesign existing courseware: best practices; pitfalls to be avoided and how to deal with them; instructional materials developed for the courses used in our project; assessment and evaluation instruments developed for the courses used in our project; instructions on adapting the assessment and evaluation instruments for other courses; instructions, documentation, and configuration scripts for using the technology needed for such collaborations. The presenters will share experiences and lead a brainstorming session to design strategies for dealing with challenges and for gaining institutional support for such collaborations. Participants are encouraged to bring their laptops to work on, but this is not required.},

abstract = {The main objective of the research is to determine the efficiency of using an environment b-learning in the acquisition of basic skills of programming though customizing the content for each student, to achieve a set of activities that can be used will be designed in the Moodle platform and contribute to teaching an initial programming course, considering three skill levels (basic, intermediate and advanced) of computational thinking of students. A mixed methodology approach will be implemented to achieve the objectives. The quantitative approach, whose characteristics using statistical measure phenomena, experimentation and use cause-effect analysis allow a sequential, deductive and testing process in generating results. The qualitative approach is conducted basically in natural environments and meanings are extracted from data allow a process that context the phenomenon and depth of ideas. To measure the cognitive level of students in computational thinking, instruments will be designed based on the bank of items released by the Computer Olympiad Talent Search in order to have reliable instruments (international proposal), valid (measures learning) and objectives (it focuses on the concept to measure) that they match with contents of subject. The main result is to generate personalized education, a learning experience that contributes to student motivation in tune with the academic goals of initial programming courses.},
