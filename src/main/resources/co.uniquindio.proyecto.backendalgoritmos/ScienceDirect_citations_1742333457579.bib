abstract = {One of the research domains in the field of sentiment analysis is automatic emotion recognition in texts which is a worthy topic in human-computer interaction. Text processing has always faced many challenges. The main one is the structural and semantic differences of sentences which have had a significant impact on the malfunction of auto-recognition systems. This problem becomes more prominent in short texts in which words and their concurrences are limited and insufficient. As a result of this, word frequency and TF-IDF weighing cannot well represent the relationship between words and the appropriate feature vector, leading to an undesirable accuracy of emotion recognition. Thus, different strategies should be applied to improve the feature vector and to formulate the features properly. The desired strategy should be able to identify the words that can distinguish between classes well and also to find the relationships between words and meaningful phrases using natural language processing concepts. In this paper, a combination of emotional models, categorical and hierarchical, are used for an emotional text recognition which could discover simultaneously explicit and implicit emotion in a short text. Our approach called DuFER, proposed a weighed method which improves the feature vector using language models and computational linguistics through applying a modified TF-IDF weighing to words as well as Maximum Likelihood Estimation weighing to expressions. Four implicit and explicit emotion datasets are used for the experiments. The results show that the accuracy of both implicit and explicit emotion recognition has increased and DuFER is actually the first successful dual framework in recognizing implicit and explicit emotions from text.}

This work proposes an innovative approach that exploits techniques typical of information retrieval (the trie data structure) to efficiently encode the solutions’ repository at the border between System 2 and System 1. This repository stores the solutions (successful plans) the agent has already used and can re-enact to achieve the goals. System 2 conceives new plans and delegates System 1 to execute them. If the plan is successful (and so it becomes a solution), System 1 stores that in the repository to quickly retrieve any solution that may help fulfil the goals deliberated by System 2 in the future.}

abstract = {M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (M1-AChR), a member of the G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) family, plays a crucial role in learning and memory, making it an important drug target for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and schizophrenia. M1-AChR activation and deactivation have shown modifying effects in AD and PD preclinical models, respectively. However, understanding the pharmacology associated with M1-AChR activation or deactivation is complex, because of the low selectivity among muscarinic subtypes, hampering their therapeutic applications. In this regard, we constructed two quantitative structure–activity relationship (QSAR) models, one for M1-AChR agonists (total and partial), and the other for the antagonists. The binding mode of 59 structurally different compounds, including agonists and antagonists with experimental binding affinity values (pKi), were analyzed employing computational molecular docking over different structures of M1-AChR. Furthermore, we considered the interaction energy (Einter), the number of rotatable bonds (NRB), and lipophilicity (ilogP) for the construction of the QSAR model for agonists (R2 = 89.64, QLMO2 = 78, and Qext2 = 79.1). For the QSAR model of antagonists (R2 = 88.44, QLMO2 = 82, and Qext2 = 78.1) we considered the Einter, the fraction of sp3 carbons fCsp3, and lipophilicity (MlogP). Our results suggest that the ligand volume is a determinant to establish its biological activity (agonist or antagonist), causing changes in binding energy, and determining the affinity for M1-AChR.}

Additionally, a subsample of 111 participants completed a resting-state fMRI scan. After investigating the impact of age on different divergent thinking metrics, we investigated the impact of age on the association between divergent thinking and resting-state functional connectivity within and between major resting-state brain networks associated with creative thinking: the DMN, ECN, and SN. Adolescents tended to be less creative than both young and older adults in divergent thinking scores related to expansion creativity, and not in persistent creativity, while young and older adults performed relatively similar. We found that adolescents’ functional integrity of the executive control network (ECN) was positively associated with expansion creativity, which was significantly different from the negative association in both the young and older adults. These results suggest that creative performance and supporting brain networks change throughout the lifespan.}

Faced with this growing heterogeneity, there is the need to advance understanding of the organisations that engage in innovation intermediation activities. To do so, we use a combination of text mining and bibliometric techniques, and we identify seven different streams of literature, six of which refer to distinct types of intermediaries that perform specific functions and often involve specific types of organisations. Looking at the evolution of the different streams of literature over time, we find that the early contributions focused on university incubators, science and technology parks, and the role they play within different types of innovation systems. More recently, the focus has shifted to the role of intermediaries in supporting sustainable transitions. Despite the differences between the various types of intermediaries and the literature streams that analyse them, the bibliographic coupling shows that all strands of literature have a common theoretical basis, which includes the open innovation approach and revolves around the role of science parks and incubators.}

It was hypothesized that these measures would reveal the engagement of local and increasingly complex cortical networks as a function of task specificity and complexity. Results indicated regionally increased neuronal signalling as a function of task complexity at frontal, temporal and parietal brain regions, although more robust task-related changes in EEG-indices of activation were derived over the left hemisphere. Both linear and non-linear indices of synchronization among EEG signals recorded from over different brain regions were consistent with the notion of more “local” processing for the number comparison task. Conversely, multiplication tasks were associated with a widespread pattern of distant signal synchronizations, which could potentially indicate increased demands for neural networks cooperation during performance of tasks that involve a greater number of cognitive operations.}

abstract = {Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), including ADHD and ASD, profoundly impact children and adolescents. Leveraging Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DeepL) on Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data offers enhanced insights, advancing the understanding and diagnostic capabilities of NDDs. Traditionally, researchers extract time series data from predefined brain regions (ROIs) using atlas-based methods and focus on generating brain functional connectivity using Pearson correlation by analyzing changes in signal amplitude over time. This conventional approach assumes that the brain’s structure can be modeled in a simple Euclidean space and predicted with conventional ML/DeepL techniques. However, these traditional methods have several drawbacks. Predefined ROI extraction fails to capture the inherent variability in brain connectivity patterns across individuals, potentially missing crucial information, while relying on Pearson correlation to analyze functional brain connectivity is sensitive to amplitude fluctuations caused by high neural oscillations, leading to inaccurate representations of true neural relationships. Modeling brain functional structure in Euclidean space does not account for the brain’s complex, non-linear neural dynamics, limiting the effectiveness of ML/DeepL models. To address these issues, we propose: 1) An approach that adapts ROIs for each subject using combined grouped Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and Dictionary Learning (DL), better representing individual brain topologies; 2) The application of Phase Locking Value (PLV) to estimate functional connectivity in the frequency domain, reducing sensitivity to amplitude variations while effectively capturing both linear and non-linear signal relationships; 3) The implementation of a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to address the brain’s non-Euclidean topological structure with graph architecture, enhancing the classification and diagnosis of neural disorders. This method was tested on the ADHD-200 dataset for ADHD and the ABIDE-I dataset for ASD, achieving high accuracy (94% ±1.3% for ADHD and 89.3% ±2.3% for ASD) through 10-fold cross-validation. The integration of data-driven ROI extraction, frequency-domain connectivity analysis, and non-Euclidean graph-based brain architecture representation collectively represents a novel approach to improving the understanding and prediction of NDDs.}

In this work, we develop the theory and associated algorithms for predicate detection in infinite runs. In practice, an infinite run can be determined in finite time if it consists of a recurrent behavior with some finite prefix. Therefore, our study is restricted to such runs. We introduce the concept of d-diagram, which is a finite representation of infinite directed graphs. Given a d-diagram that represents an infinite distributed computation, we solve the problem of determining if a global predicate ever became true in the computation. The crucial aspect of this problem is the stopping rule that tells us when to conclude that the predicate can never become true in future. We also provide an algorithm to provide vector timestamps to events in the computation for determining the dependency relationship between any two events in the infinite run. Finally, we give an algorithm to compute a slice of a d-diagram which concisely captures all the consistent global states of the computation satisfying the given predicate.}

abstract = {Computational experiment approach considers modelling as the essential feature of Inquiry-Based Science Education (IBSE) where the model and the computer take the place of the “classical” experimental set-up and simulation replaces the experiment (Landau, Páez, & Bordeianu, 2008). Modelling, as a pedagogical tool, involves the model construction, the exploration of model characteristics and the model application to a specific problem, resembling authentic activities of scientists and mathematicians (Herbert, 2003). Jonassen and Strobel (2006) state that in addition to modelling domain knowledge, learners can apply modelling skills in different ways: by modelling domain knowledge, by modelling problems (constructing problem spaces), by modelling systems and by modelling semantic structures. The purpose of this study was to explore the effects of the Computational Experiment Mathematical Modelling (CEMM) approach on University students': a) reasoning abilities, b) learning performance, c) epistemological beliefs, and d) argumentation. Students worked in a learning environment which contained applications in Physics created by the author and all of them were based on mathematical models, as the model was considered as the fundamental unit of instruction (Hestenes, 1999). Fifty (50) pre-service primary school university students participated in this project and results indicated a strong relationship between students' learning performance, performance in the scientific reasoning abilities test, epistemic beliefs and the ability to use arguments during computational experiments. This paper suggests an implementable integration strategy that uses mathematical models for physics phenomena that are developed using algorithms, aiming to deepen students' conceptual understanding and scientific reasoning. After completing the course, the mechanics baseline test (MBT) and a test on Heat were administered. The results indicated that there was a significant difference in problem-solving skill test mean scores, as measured by the MBT, and the test on Heat among concrete, formal and postformal reasoners. Overall, this study provides evidence that scientific reasoning has a strong impact to learning performance, scientific reasoning, epistemological beliefs and argumentation while the methodology of the Computational Experiment provides essential tools to students to implement Inquiry based scenario. Students developed their scenarios using an open source repository using the computational experiment approach and created their experiments using the Argument-Driven Inquiry (ADI) laboratory approach. Results have implications for the effectiveness of the computational experiment as a methodology to be included in the STEM agenda.}

We examine the underpinnings of this phenomenon using drift diffusion modeling (DDM). Partisans (N = 148) completed a sequential sampling task where they evaluated the honesty of Democrat or Republican politicians during a debate based on fact-check scores. We found that partisans required less and weaker evidence to correctly categorize the ingroup as more honest, and were more accurate on trials when the ingroup candidate was more honest, compared to the outgroup. DDM revealed that such tendencies arise from both a prior preference for categorizing the ingroup as more honest (i.e., biased starting point) and more precise accumulation of information favoring the ingroup candidate compared to the outgroup (i.e., biased drift rate). Moreover, individual differences in cognitive reasoning moderated task performance for the most devoted partisans and maintained divergent associations with the DDM parameters. This suggests that partisans may reach biased conclusions via different pathways depending on their depth of cognitive reasoning. These findings provide key insights into the mechanisms driving partisan divides in polarized environments, and can inform interventions that reduce impasse and conflict.}

First, a firm needs to ensure that the exploration unit is sufficiently connected to other parts of the organization where key complementary assets reside while minimizing the number of linkages to reduce the influence of the “old” way of thinking on new exploration efforts, to reduce coordination costs, and to increase adaptive ability. Second, the “ideal” level of connectedness for structural ambidexterity ultimately depends on the number of valuable complementary assets in a firm’s possession. We also show how managers can combine analytical methods from the computational literature on network analysis with managerial adjustments to do so in practice.}

Some of the most common aspects of computational physics problems are: a grid, a clock which tracks the flow of the simulation, and a set of models describing the dynamics of various quantities on the grid. Having a framework that could deal with these basic aspects of the simulation in a common way could provide great value to computational scientists by solving various numerical and class design issues that routinely arise. This paper describes the newly developed computational framework that we have built for rapidly prototyping new physics codes. This framework, called turboPy, is a lightweight physics modeling framework based on the design of the particle-in-cell code turboWAVE. It implements a class (called Simulation) which drives the simulation and manages communication between physics modules, a class (called PhysicsModule) which handles the details of the dynamics of the various parts of the problem, and some additional classes such as a Grid class and a Diagnostic class to handle various ancillary issues that commonly arise.

More specifically, we show how to improve existing voting-based ensemble models trained to predict the next-day exchange rate trend with no need for retraining or other costly computational tasks. We assume that calendar effects would constrain investors’ actions; furthermore, their constrained individual actions would collectively induce deterministic patterns in the financial time-series movement. Hence, financial time-series forecasting models could be prone to monthly repeat their performance patterns, and we could use this information to obtain better predictions and consistently achieve profit. To verify the effectiveness of our methodology, we predicted the sign of the US Dollar to Brazilian Real rate variation. Our proposed models generated a profit metric value 24% higher than the original voting-based ensemble models with 16% lower volatility, gathering two positive elements: higher return with lower risk. The experiments’ outcomes supported the hypothesis that there are considerable improvements with almost no extra computational effort by taking into account behavioral patterns in foreign exchange predictions.}

abstract = {This paper proposes a novel algorithm for fast and accurate Hausdorff distance (HD) computation. The Hausdorff distance is used to measure the similarity between two point sets in various applications. However, it is hard to compute the HD algorithm efficiently between very large-scale point sets while ensuring the accuracy of the HD. The directed HD algorithm has two loops (called the outer loop and the inner loop) for calculating MAX-MIN distance, and the state-of-the-art algorithms, such as the Early break method and the Diffusion search method, focused on reducing the iterations of the inner loop. Our algorithm, however, concentrates on reducing the iterations of the outer loop. The proposed method simultaneously computes the temporary HD and temporary minimum distances of points corresponding to the outer loop using the opposite HD computation with very small systematic samples. Thereafter, a strategy of ruling out is employed to exclude non-contributing points. The new approach reduces the problems of different grid sizes and highly overlapping point sets as well as the very large-scale point sets. 3-D point clouds and real brain tumor segmentation (MRI 3-D volumes) are used for comparing the performance of the proposed algorithm and the state-of-the-art HD algorithms. In experimental results with 3-D point clouds, the proposed method is more than at least 1.5 times as faster as the compared algorithms. And, in experimental results with MRI 3-D volumes, the proposed method achieves a better performance than the compared algorithms over all pairs regardless of the grid size. Thus, as a whole, the proposed algorithm outperforms the compared algorithms.}

Part of this challenge takes the form of keeping their mood within certain boundaries, and in particular avoiding (too) negative moods when facing negative events from time to time. In this paper a generic computational model for this regulative process is presented. The model serves as a framework or architecture in which various additional elements can be incorporated. To evaluate the suitability of this framework, the model has been extended by incorporating therapeutical interventions for four different types of therapy. The obtained intervention models have been used to model and compare different therapies for a variety of patient types by simulation experiments and by formal verification. Simulation experiments are reported showing that the mood regulation and depression indeed follow expected patterns when applying these therapies. These models form building block for intelligent therapy support systems.}

For economizing the electricity bill of industry users, the trend on configuring user-side energy storage system (UES) by users will increase continuously. On the base of currently implemented TOU environment, designing an efficient and non-utility-dispatched guidance strategy for UES to realize the peak-shaving and valley-filling will have a great significance. Therefore, this paper firstly proposes a thinking based on a linear piecewise-shape pricing strategy for guiding UES to decrease the peak-valley difference although storage has not been dispatched by utility and always operates in its maximum benefit. In addition, benefit of user with UES has been guaranteed to be non-decreased compared to traditional TOU. Then, this paper establishes a planning-operation co-optimization model for UES to pursue its maximum net benefit, in which the proposed electricity pricing strategy has been incorporated. Thirdly, a linearized reliability improvement calculation method contributed by storage has been presented. Finally, the numerical results have verified the effectiveness of the proposed strategy, and in the designed case condition, there is an obvious improvement in the percentage of peak-valley difference and the reliability level.}

A quasi-experimental study that utilized a non-equivalent groups design was conducted with 91 fifth-grade students, comprising a control group (n = 46) who received the PBP intervention, and an intervention group (n = 45) who received the REP intervention. Creative self-efficacy, Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking Figural (TTCT-Figural), and assessment of the students’ robotic creative products were conducted to evaluate students’ creativity. In addition, t tests, ANCOVA, and ANOVA were used to analyze the data to determine whether REP could improve students’ creativity better than PBP. The results showed that REP could enhance students’ creative self-efficacy and their robotic creative products score more than PBP could, but not the TTCT-Figural score after the confounding effect of fluency was controlled for. In the intervention group, creative self-efficacy and creative thinking were improved after intervention. Overall, REP has more advantages than PBP for promoting primary school students' creativity. The findings of this study provide a reference and teaching strategies guidance for the cultivation of K-12 students' creativity in robotics education.}

We consider Puzzle-based Learning tenets as well as their educational impacts on both critical thinking and learner engagement and provide an original proposal concerning the understanding of puzzles. Our proposal centered on the dynamics of puzzles bears conceptual and educational facets. Conceptually, puzzle dynamics is viewed as composed of two elements: a mechanism, the Puzzle Trigger, and a process, the Puzzle-Solving. From an educational point of view, the rationale for integrating Puzzle Triggers in Puzzle-based Learning is meant to help learners interact with puzzles and consequently become motivated and engaged in the Puzzle-Solving process. This way, learners' critical thinking skills are reinforced and focused on finding solutions to challenges. We illustrate the implementation of Puzzle Triggers and Puzzle-Solving by considering two instructional activities in a Software Development undergraduate course of an online learning Informatics Engineering Program.}

abstract = {Computation today is interactive agency in social networks. In this discussion paper, we look at this trend through the lens of logic, identifying two main lines. One is ‘epistemization’, making computational tasks refer explicitly to knowledge or beliefs of the agents performing them. The other line is using games as a model for computation, leading to ‘gamification’ of classical tasks, and computing by agents that may have preferences. This provides ingredients for a fundamental theory of computation that shifts from what is computed to how it is computed and by whom, moving from output to social behavior. The true impact of this shift is not in learning how to replace humans, but in creating new societies where humans and machines interact. While we do not offer a Turing-style account of this richer world, we discuss what becomes of three classical themes: the Universal Machine, Church's Thesis and the Turing Test.1}

This study provides an overview encompassing multi-chaos, fractal, fractional and Artificial Intelligence (AI) way of thinking for the solution of the complex system problems concerned with natural and social sciences. Furthermore, ethical decision-making frameworks and strategies concerning big data and AI applications to provide assistance for the identification of the related problems in different settings and help thinking in a methodical manner with a deliberative compensating process so that tensions between conflicting aspects can be managed systematically. The values related to ethical issues, which are thorny in nature, point to being practical, flexible and problem-driven rather than purely theory-driven in order that dilemmas can be addressed and critical decision-making guided in a way beyond theoretical positions with a focus on applied aspects. Through the lenses of such transformative thinking along with mathematics-informed frameworks encompassing chaos, fractal and multi-fractional ways, the incorporation of technology, with Artificial Intelligence, as the most viable and far-reaching leg, is essentially required to be able to address and tackle complexity that has chaotic, nonlinear, and dynamic characteristics. Hence, optimized solutions can be conceived and implemented efficiently and in a facilitating way with some required degree of flexibility as well. Considering the impact and ubiquity of data technologies concerning all aspects of modern life, it becomes important to establish a balance between data use and ethical matters. Computational technologies in different complex systems based on mathematical-driven informed frameworks can enable the generation of more realistic and applicable adaptive models under transient, dynamic and ever-evolving conditions of different complex systems.}

The computational methods developed for these 3D simulations include a stabilized space-time finite element formulation to accommodate for the shape changes, special mesh generation and mesh moving strategies developed for this purpose, iterative solution techniques for the large, coupled nonlinear equation systems involved, and parallel implementation of all these methods on scalable computing systems such as the Thinking Machines CM-5.

In that model, there were four boundedly rational behavioral rules (step-j, j=0, 1, 2, 3), each corresponding to an integer level of depth of reasoning. It is legitimate to ask for a justification of the restriction to these `integer' rules. Why is it not reasonable to suppose that some player believes that 50% of the population is step-0, and 50% is step-1, and so himself adopts something like a step-1.5 rule? This paper constructs a tractable model with potentially infinitely many non-integer rules and conducts comparison tests. The main conclusion is that allowing for non-integer rules does not help to explain the data. Therefore, by Occam's Razor, the integer rule model is preferred. These results suggest that step-j thinking is a fact of human nature rather that an arbitrary modelling restriction.}

abstract = {Based on the principles and paradigms of computational knowledge-based vision discussed in this chapter, we practice at the representational and algorithmic levels for the take of image-to-image translation. The image-to-image translation aims to learn the mapping between two visual domains. At the beginning of designing the existing image-to-image translation method, it was not considered whether the generated image is realistic or not. In this work, we present a novel approach to address the problem of generating fidelity in the area of image-to-image translation. In particular, humans judge whether an image is realistic or not with unique human vision's feeling rather than paying attention to the real-world semantics. Inspired by this, we propose an effective network loss to capture the pixel-level representations and human vision system information for verisimilar image-to-image translation. To enforce both structural and translation-model consistency during adaptation, we propose a novel Just-Noticeable-Difference loss based on a visual recognition task. The Just-Noticeable-Difference loss not only guides the overall representation to be discriminative but also enforces our cycle loss before and after mapping between domains. Experimental results show that our approach is able to generate realistic images using unpaired training data, on a wide range of tasks. Besides, we measure realism with Fréchet Inception Distance and diversity with the number of statistically-different bins, Jensen–Shannon divergence, and a perceptual distance metric. We also apply our approach to domain adaptation and show competitive performance when compared to others on several datasets.}

We discuss the topical structures of ICCS, and show how these topics have evolved over time in response to the topicality of various domains, technologies and methods, and how all these topics relate to one another. This analysis illustrates the multidisciplinary research and collaborations among scientific communities, by constructing static and dynamic networks from the topic modelling results and from the authors’ keywords. The results of this study provide insights regarding the past and future trends of core discussion topics in computational science and show how “computational thinking” has propagated across different fields of study. We used the Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) topic modelling algorithm to discover topics. The resulting topics were then manually labelled and grouped hierarchically on three levels. Next, we applied trend analysis and Change Point Analysis (CPA) to study the evolution of topics over seventeen years and to identify the growing and disappearing topics. We used Gephi to examine the static networks of topics, and an R library called DyA to analyse the dynamic networks of topics. We also analysed the conference as a platform for potential collaboration development through the perspective of collaboration networks. The results show that authors of ICCS papers continue to actively collaborate after the conference − on average authors collaborate with three other ICCS authors, − which suggests that ICCS is a valuable platform for collaboration development.}

In this paper, we give a couple of examples for algorithm synthesis using the lazy thinking paradigm. These examples illustrate how the synthesized algorithm depends on the algorithm scheme used. Also, we give details about the implementation of the lazy thinking algorithm synthesis method in the frame of the Theorema system. In this implementation, the synthesis of the example algorithms can be carried out completely automatically, i.e. without any user interaction.}

This phenomenon, referred to as the temporal discounting sign effect, is thought to result from the greater anticipated emotional impact of waiting for a negative outcome (dread) compared to waiting for a positive outcome (mixture of savoring and impatience). The impact of such anticipatory emotions has been proposed to rely on episodic future thinking. We evaluated this proposal by examining the presence and magnitude of a sign effect in the intertemporal decisions of individuals with hippocampal amnesia, who are severely impaired in their ability to engage in episodic mental simulation, and by comparing their patterns of choices to those of healthy controls. We also measured loss aversion, the tendency to assign greater value to losses compared to equivalent gains, to verify that any reduction in the sign effect in the hippocampal lesion group could not be explained by a group difference in loss aversion. Results showed that participants with hippocampal amnesia exhibited a sign effect, with less discounting of monetary losses compared to gains, that was similar in magnitude to that of controls. Loss aversion, albeit greater in the hippocampal compared to the control group, did not account for the sign effect. These results indicate that the sign effect does not depend on the integrity of hippocampally mediated episodic processes. They suggest instead that the impact of anticipatory emotions can be factored into decisions via semantic future thinking, drawing on non-contextual knowledge about oneself.}

The review presents empirical investigations with young learners and reports on relevant frameworks and curriculum programs, effects of teaching approaches and educational tools on learning, and learning outcomes and pedagogical benefits of teaching programming. Based on the empirical studies reviewed in this study, programming can be introduced to young learners as a stand-alone subject matter or can be integrated in the regular kindergarten curriculum with other subject areas such as music, movement and dance, art, science, mathematics, and literacy. In addition, programming can be infused in literacy and storytelling activities as a developmentally appropriate delivery approach. The authors conclude that future research should devote time and effort in the development of educational curricula in which the teaching of programming is fully integrated, as well as teacher training programs so that teachers become competent to teach programming in early childhood education.}

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating condition with no known effective drug treatments. Existing drugs only alleviate symptoms. Given repeated expensive drug failures, we assessed systematically whether approved and investigational AD drugs are targeting products of genes strongly associated with AD and whether these genes are targeted by existing drugs for other indications which could be re-purposed.
Methods
We identified genes strongly associated with late-onset AD from the loci of genetic variants associated with AD at genome-wide-significance and from a gene-based test applied to the most extensively genotyped late-onset AD case (n = 17,008)-control (n = 37,154) study, the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project. We used three gene-to-drug cross-references, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, Drugbank and Drug Repurposing Hub, to identify genetically validated targets of AD drugs and any existing drugs or nutraceuticals targeting products of the genes strongly associated with late-onset AD.
Findings
A total of 67 autosomal genes (forming 9 gene clusters) were identified as strongly associated with late-onset AD, 28 from the loci of single genetic variants, 51 from the gene-based test and 12 by both methods. Existing approved or investigational AD drugs did not target products of any of these 67 genes. Drugs for other indications targeted 11 of these genes, including immunosuppressive disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs targeting PTK2B gene products.
Interpretation
Approved and investigational AD drugs are not targeting products of genes strongly associated with late-onset AD. However, other drugs targeting products of these genes exist and could perhaps be re-purposing to combat late-onset AD after further scrutiny.}

The work of Kosslyn, aimed at clarifying the basic process components and the general mechanics of the imaging process and Finke's probing of the levels of equivalence between imagery and perception, also belong to the conceptual category of research where the focus is on the nature and properties of imagery. Experimental evidence from a task devised by Finke indicates an important role of visual imagery in the integration of initially unrelated elements of experience into new combinations. This experimental evidence lends support to theories of symbolic representations that emphasize the potential of visual imagery as a vehicle for creative thought. Even if Chambers and Reisberg have overstated their case in their distinction between perceiving and imaging, they have, nevertheless, been able to demonstrate an important dimension of difference between two types of activities.}

To complement the group-based activities, this study designs and assesses an analytics-enhanced discussion forum for whole-class interactions. The forum adopts ontology-based recommender systems and anomaly detection techniques to tailor the threads and contents for individual students in a personalized way. This analytics-enhanced forum was implemented in a large-size undergraduate design course (n = 313), and data about student responses to this forum was compared with data from the previous year’s course that adopted a conventional forum (n = 280). From the statistical analysis, students learning with the analytics-enhanced forum demonstrated significantly higher degrees of design practices (specifically, empathize, define, ideate, and test), collaborative learning, and course satisfaction. Qualitative analysis of students’ focus-group interviews shows their perceived benefits and concerns of the analytics-enhanced forum. The study also suggests integrating generative artificial intelligence and large language models to support students’ design thinking and collaborative design.}

Many essential features of Turing-equivalent computation are not captured in definitions of computation as (digital) symbol manipulation. Turing-equivalent computation did not play the role in McCulloch and Pitts’s early cybernetic work that is sometimes attributed to it. Finally, various segments of the neuroscientific community invoke a notion of computation that differs from the Turing-equivalent notion.}

Although distance education and online learning have been adopted gradually recently, it has become the 'New Normal.' In this situation of uncertainty, facilitators must keep themselves updated with the various teaching/learning strategies and encourage learners to get accustomed to the online classroom environment. Furthermore, assisting the learners with active engagement in the classes is essential. Hence, to create an instigated environment for assessing the competency level and addressing the motivational behaviour of the learners in the online courses, a modified version of the "ARCS" (Attention, Relevance, Confidence, and Satisfaction) model is used in this research work. The core objective of this model is to apply a modified motivational model, namely "ARCS-PC," where PC represents Professional Competency. Professional competency includes Critical Thinking skills, Digital literacy, Creative Thinking, Problem-solving, and Time Management. The incorporation of digital quizzes, assignments, and interactive activities using Information and Communication Technology (ICT) tools was done in the ARCS-PC Model. The online classroom lectures and activities were conducted using the Microsoft Teams (MS Teams) educational platform. Linear regression is performed to analyze the modified ARCS-PC model. These technology-enabled online classes and ICT tools have helped teach lifelong learning, collaborative learning, a student-centric approach, and better competency skills to effectively engage students in online courses. In our proposed method, an improvement of 11.21 % was observed in the student's performance compared to a maximum of 8.8 % in the existing traditional models. Detailed analysis and quantification of the proposed method are given in the paper.}

For living systems, mathematical relations emerge internally as an abstracting capacity in the course of development and adaptation to the external world. All living systems possess internal coding structures which represent their embedded description. They are anticipatory in the sense that the embedded description generates deterministic model of their behavior. If the model does not provide a correct result, they can evolve through the acquisition of new statements inside the embedded description that overcome limitations of the existing model. The newly generated statements acquire meaning in and from the changing environment. The growth of complexity, being a consequence of the internal active adaptation to externality performed by the systems, increases the amount of external work and generates the observed patterns of spatiotemporal structures of evolving systems. In living systems, the symbolic memory constraints are dynamic processes in themselves, co-evolving with the other components of biological systems. Separation of the symbolic memory and the dynamic laws (defined as the epistemic cut), required for self-replication of biological systems, forms the basis for their onto-epistemic relation to reality. In this regard, living systems possess their own internal abstracting capacity and invent mathematics. The digital structure of the genetic code is a manifestation of this mathematics.}

Social media interactions, characterized by anonymity and performativity, can help differentiate between authentic perspectives and misinformation. With its diverse user base and wide-ranging discussions, Reddit provides a valuable data source for analyzing public sentiment. To explore changes in discourse, we investigated linguistic features such as clout, authenticity, emotional expression, and analytical thinking. We used Computer-Mediated Discourse Analysis (CMDA) and Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) software to conduct qualitative content analysis and quantitative goodness-of-fit tests. Analytical thinking reflects how systematically users present political arguments, while clout captures the confidence and authority of discourse, highlighting dominant voices. Authenticity measures the sincerity of discourse, and emotional tone reveals users’ feelings toward KSA. Our findings show an overall increase in analytical discourse and a decrease in negative tone, although emotional sentiment remained largely negative. Peaks in clout, authenticity, and emotional tone corresponded to major political events, indicating how such events shape public attitudes. These results suggest that significant political and social events influence both the content and tone of political discourse and may, in turn, impact public perceptions and emotions.}

The approach is illustrated within the context of additive manufacturing of non-conformal cellular structures. The paper concludes that parametric design thinking that omits a definition of topological relationships risks brittleness and failure in later design stages while a consideration of topology can create enhanced and smarter solutions as it can modify parameters based on an accommodation of the design context.}

In this paper, we propose a sentence similarity analysis model to analyze the similarity in people’s opinions on hot topics in social media and news pages. Most of these data are unstructured or semi-structured sentences, so the accuracy of sentence similarity analysis largely determines the model’s performance. For the purpose of improving accuracy, we propose a novel method of sentence similarity computation to extract the syntactic and semantic information of the semi-structured and unstructured sentences. We mainly consider the subjects, predicates and objects of sentence pairs and use Stanford Parser to classify the dependency relation triples to calculate the syntactic and semantic similarity between two sentences. Finally, we verify the performance of the model with the Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus (MRPC), which consists of 4076 pairs of training sentences and 1725 pairs of test sentences, and most of the data came from the news of social data. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods regarding the correlation coefficient and the mean deviation.}

abstract = {Numerous creativity techniques have been purposed and applied in creativity support system. Because most creativity techniques are used informally and hardly represented formally in computer, it becomes very difficult to build the computational cognitive model of user applying those techniques. However the model is necessary for creativity support systems to detect or predict the change of user's cognitive state in time and make some adaption to avoid inhibiting creativity of user. In this paper we introduce extension creative idea generation method which has the characteristics of formalization and systematization. The method can be represented by extension rules which provide the precondition to build computational cognitive model of user in creativity support systems. The computational cognitive model of user learning in applying extension creative idea generation method is presented through experiments. The experimental results show how and when the user will develop the application skill of creativity technique and inhibit his creativity.}

A complex system, in that regard, is literally one where multiple interactions occur and emerge among the components; and common to all research into complexity are the systems that have adapting, self-organizing, synchronizing, and reacting elements. As physicist Nigel Goldenfeld put very aptly, “Complexity starts when causality breaks down.” Complexity manifests as varying challenges in fields of different complex systems. The inherent complexity of the related phenomena in the fields is beyond the reductionist outlook of traditional science; thus, complexity requires an understanding that extends across a class of complex problems that have so many intricate and subtle attributes that are much more innovative and novel ways of thinking as well as applicable laws are of critical importance. Evolution, order and complexity reveal the relationship between natural and social worlds, which reflects a modern way of thinking that challenges the dichotomy of natural and social. This study provides a conceptual outline and historical account of complexity and complex systems as well as complex order processes toward modern scientific path from Darwin and onwards concerned with natural, applied and social sciences. In the parlance of complex systems, the modern way of thinking based on the transition from evolutionary dimension can be viewed as a revolutionary pedestal, which is a new paradigm for natural sciences and social sciences so that the foundation for the complex systems' interpretations can be explored by the relevant domains.}

The intervention takes place in two academic years analyzing the practice of integrating coding and visual blocks programming in sciences and arts. The “Computational concepts and computational practices” dimension details a quasi-experimental approach, which showed significant improvement regarding learning programming concepts, logic, and computational practices with an active approach. The “Learning processes and coding in primary education” dimension analyzes the practice of the experimental group through questionnaires and structured observation. In this pedagogical design, students interact and create their own content related to curricular areas with several advantages, such as motivation, fun, commitment, and enthusiasm, showing improvements related to computational thinking and computational practices. Understanding of computational concepts through an active approach, Project Based Learning, usefulness, motivation, and commitment underline the importance and effectiveness of implementing a Visual Programming Language from active methodologies in primary education. Due to the aforementioned benefits and positive results obtained in this research, it is recommended to implement a Visual Programming Language in educational settings in 5th and 6th grade in primary education through a cross-curricular implementation.}

Molecular weight distribution (MWD) and branching distribution (BD) are modeled by applying a combination of population balance modeling, the method of moments and branching pseudo distributions. Special cares have been taken to incorporate the effects of scission and crosslinking reactions. Further, effective strategies have been provided to mitigate the computational complexity of solving balance equations. The models have been applied to the case of increasing residence time in a recycling extruder. The simulated MWD of the recycled LDPE exhibits a shift towards lower chain lengths for residence times up to 400s, while for higher residence times the high MW tail forms. The evolution of the simulated BD during recycling reveals important modifications versus the original virgin LDPE with implications for derived properties.}

Each septum has a pore that allows for inter-compartmental and inter-hyphal streaming of cytosol and even organelles. The compartments, however, have special organelles, Woronin bodies, that can plug the pores. When the pores are blocked, no flow of cytoplasm takes place. Inspired by the controllable compartmentalisation within the mycelium of the ascomycetous fungi we designed two-dimensional fungal automata. A fungal automaton is a cellular automaton where communication between neighbouring cells can be blocked on demand. We demonstrate computational universality of the fungal automata by implementing sandpile cellular automata circuits there. We reduce the Monotone Circuit Value Problem to the Fungal Automaton Prediction Problem. We construct families of wires, cross-overs and gates to prove that the fungal automata are P-complete.}

This highlights the familiar local-to-global aspect of border formation (linking of edge elements to form contours) with the much less studied global-to-local aspect (which edge elements form part of the same shape). To address this task we show how to incorporate certain high-level notions of distance and geometric arrangement into a form that can influence image-based edge information. The center of the argument is a reaction—diffusion equation that reveals how (global) aspects of the distance map (that is, shape) can be “read out” locally, suggesting a solution to the border ownership problem. Since the reaction—diffusion equation defines a field, a possible information processing role for the local field potential can be defined. We argue that such fields also underlie the Gestalt notion of closure, especially when it is refined using modern experimental techniques. An important implication of this theoretical argument is that, if true, then network modeling must be extended to include the substrate surrounding spiking neurons, including glia.}

Game theory provides a canonical model of strategic thinking implicit in the notion of equilibrium and common knowledge of rationality. Behavioral evidence shows departures from equilibrium play and suggests different models of strategic thinking based on bounded rationality. We report neural evidence in support of non-equilibrium models of strategic thinking. These models suggest a cognitive-hierarchy theory of brain and behavior, according to which people use different levels of strategic thinking that are associated with specific neural computations.}

Our goal is to examine differences between boys and girls using eye-tracking as an objective measure and triangulating the findings with qualitative data coming from children's interviews. The results show no statistically significant difference between female and male gaze and learning gain during the coding activity; interestingly, the qualitative data show differences in the strategies and implemented practices during coding, and in perceptions about those coding activities. Our results highlight that further studies need to utilize objective measures and unveil necessary differences in the design and implementation of coding activities. Furthermore, our results provide objective evidence that female students do not lack in competences compared to boys, but simply that they have a different approach during coding activities and different perspectives about coding, an approach that needs to be cultivated and nurtured.}

First, a two-step cluster analysis was administered to find how three ePCR-related knowledge: ePCR functionality, coding skills, and computational thinking skills, were integrated to teach students ePCR technology in middle-grade math lessons. Results showed three types of lesson plans, including lessons to use basic ePCR functionality to teach students lower-level CT skills, lessons to teach students basic to intermediate coding skills, and lessons to use the technology at the advanced level. Next, we applied the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) framework and conducted a second two-step cluster analysis to identify how the technology (ePCR technology), content (math knowledge), and pedagogy (activity design) were integrated into those lesson plans. Results suggested ten clusters of lesson plans with distinct features. We summarized those ten lesson clusters into five categories: 1) ePCR technology lessons, 2) transdisciplinary problem-based learning lessons, 3) technology-assisted lessons, 4) lessons without real-world connections, and 5) lessons integrating middle-grade math learning into ePCR projects.

abstract = {Mental health disorders pose a significant challenge to society. The Bayesian perspective on the mind offers unique insights and tools that may help address a variety of mental health conditions. Psychopathological dysfunctions are often connected to altered predictive and active inference processes, in which cognitive and physiological pathogenic beliefs shape the clinical condition and its symptoms. However, there is a lack of general empirical models that integrate cognitive beliefs, physiological experience, and symptoms in healthy and clinical populations. In this study, we examined the relationship between altered predictive mechanisms, interoception, and pathological bodily distortions in healty individuals and in individuals suffering from anorexia nervosa (AN). AN patients (N=15) completed a Virtual Reality Full-Body Illusion along with interoceptive tasks twice: at hospital admission during an acute symptomatological phase (Time 1) and after a 12-week outpatient clinical weight-restoring rehabilitative program (Time 2). Results were compared to a healthy control group. Our findings indicated that higher levels of interoceptive metacognitive awareness were associated with a greater embodiment. However, unlike in healthy participants, AN patients' interoceptive metacognition was linked to embodiment even in multisensory mismatching (asynchronous) conditions. In addition, unlike in healthy participants, higher interoceptive metacognition in AN patients was related to prior abnormal bodily distortions during the acute symptomatology phase. Prediction errors in bodily estimates predicted posterior bodily estimate distortions after the illusion, but while this relationship was only significant in the synchronous condition in healthy participants, there was no significant difference between synchronous and asynchronous conditions in AN patients. Despite the success of the rehabilitation program in restoring some dysfunctional patterns in the AN group, prediction errors and posterior estimate distortions were present at hospital discharge. Our findings suggest that individuals with AN prioritize interoceptive metacognitive processes (i.e., confidence in their own perceived sensations rather than their actual perceptions), disregarding bottom-up bodily inputs in favour of their prior altered top-down beliefs. Moreover, even if the rehabilitative program partially mitigated these alterations, the pathological condition impaired the patients' ability to coherently update their prior erroneous expectations with real-time multisensory bottom-up bodily information, possibly locking the patients in the experience of a distorted prior top-down belief. These results suggest new therapeutic perspectives and introduce the framework of regenerative virtual therapy (RVT), which aims at utilizing technology-based somatic modification techniques to restructure the maladaptive priors underlying a pathological condition.}

This strategy enables us to carry out these computations with millions of coupled, nonlinear equations, and thus resolve the flow features in great detail. At Reynolds number 300 and 800, our results indicate strong 3D features arising from the instability of the columnar vortices forming the Karman street.

This paper combines these approaches in a novel methodology for generating modular design options for extensions of existing buildings (an efficacious form of building adaptation). The methodology focuses on key architectural design metrics such as energy use, daylighting, life cycle impact, life cycle costing and structural complexity, whereby a set of Pareto-optimal exploratory design options are generated for evaluation and further design development. A functional demonstration is then carried out for the extension of Ken Soble Tower in Hamilton, Ontario. The contribution of this research is the efficient development and evaluation of design options for improving existing residential infrastructure in order to meet required energy improvements using modular extensions.}

abstract = {This article addresses knowledge transfer dynamics in agent-based computational social science. The goal of the text is twofold. First, it describes the tensions arising from the convergence of different disciplinary traditions in the emergence of this new area of study and, second, it shows how these tensions are dealt with through the articulation of distinctive practices of knowledge production and transmission. To achieve this goal, three major instances of knowledge transfer dynamics in agent-based computational social science are analysed. The first instance is the emergence of the research field. Relations of knowledge transfer and cross-fertilisation between agent-based computational social science and wider and more established disciplinary areas: complexity science, computational science and social science, are discussed. The second instance is the approach to scientific modelling in the field. It is shown how the practice of agent-based modelling is affected by the conflicting coexistence of shared methodological commitments transferred from both empirical and formal disciplines. Lastly, the third instance pertains internal practices of knowledge production and transmission. Through the discussion of these practices, the tensions arising from converging dissimilar disciplinary traditions in agent-based computational social science are highlighted.}

Computational modeling provides a framework for delineating specific processes underlying social cognition and relating them to neural activity and behavior. We provide a primer on the computational modeling approach and describe how it has been used to elucidate psychological and neural mechanisms of impression formation, social learning, moral decision making, and intergroup bias.}

As such the legitimacy of others forms of knowledge have been called into question, particularly those methods that characterise the ‘softer’ sciences, and even the arts. This paper begins with an extended discussion concerning the main features of a complex system, and the nature of the boundaries that emerge within such systems. Subsequent to this discussion, and by assuming that the Universe at some level can be well-described as a complex system, the paper explores the notion of ontology, or existence, from a complex systems perspective. It is argued that none of the traditional objects of science, or any objects from any discipline, formal or not, can be said to be real in any absolute sense although a substantial realism may be temporarily associated with them. The limitations of the natural sciences is discussed as well as the deep connection between the ‘hard’ and the ‘soft’ sciences. As a result of this complex systems analysis, an evolutionary philosophy referred to as quasi-‘critical pluralism’ is outlined, which is more sensitive to the demands of complexity than contemporary reductionistic approaches.}

These systems have the power to provide solutions to cope with an aging population, address climate change, and improve issues of health, public safety and mobility. As a product of the fourth industrial revolution, these systems are currently inviting much interest. However, there are barriers that need to be considered and understood to be able to optimise the potential of these systems to support a more sustainable future. To this end, transdisciplinary skills and a combination of different mindsets are needed to be able to ask the right questions at the right time. There are several approaches that can help us to initiate constructing innovative, transformative, future-oriented and systematic ideas and questions. The three important approaches that are suggested in this article are systems mindset, design mindset and futuristic mindset. These mindsets combined with the transdisciplinary perspective – where different disciplines work jointly to create sustainable solutions not only for today but also for tomorrow – have the power to change the world. This article underlines the importance of transdisciplinarity, presents the three mindsets and illustrates a hypothetical use case on how to blend these three mindsets to enable creative work in the future's transdisciplinary world for human-centred and sustainable future.}

We first used data from 69 in-depth, semi-structured interviews with low-income residents and community stakeholders to further explore how violence impacts New York City's low-income residents of color, as well as the role of city government in providing tangible support for violence prevention during co-occurring health (COVID-19) and social (anti-Black racism) pandemics. Residents described how COVID-19 and the Black Lives Matter movement impacted safety in their communities while offering direct recommendations to improve safety. Residents also shared recommendations that indirectly improve community safety by addressing long term systemic issues. As the recruitment of interviewees was concluding, researchers facilitated two focus groups with 38 interviewees to discuss similar topics. In order to assess the degree to which the themes discovered in our qualitative interviews were shared by the broader community, we developed an integrative community data science study which leveraged natural language processing and computer vision techniques to study text and images on public social media data of 12 million tweets generated by residents. We joined computational methods with qualitative analysis through a social work lens and design justice principles to most accurately and holistically analyze the community perceptions of gun violence issues and potential prevention strategies. Findings indicate valuable community-based insights that elucidate how the co-occurring pandemics impact residents' experiences of gun violence and provide important implications for gun violence prevention in a digital era.}

Disorganization, presenting as impairment in thought, language and goal-directed behavior, is a core multidimensional syndrome of psychotic disorders. This study examined whether scalable computational measures of spoken language, and smartphone usage pattern, could serve as digital biomarkers of clinical disorganization symptoms.
Methods
We examined in a longitudinal cohort of adults with a psychotic disorder, the associations between clinical measures of disorganization and computational measures of 1) spoken language derived from monthly, semi-structured, recorded clinical interviews; and 2) smartphone usage pattern derived via passive sensing technologies over the month prior to the interview. The language features included speech quantity, rate, fluency, and semantic regularity. The smartphone features included data missingness and phone usage during sleep time. The clinical measures consisted of the Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS) conceptual disorganization, difficulty in abstract thinking, and poor attention, items. Mixed linear regression analyses were used to estimate both fixed and random effects.
Results
Greater severity of clinical symptoms of conceptual disorganization was associated with greater verbosity and more disfluent speech. Greater severity of conceptual disorganization was also associated with greater missingness of smartphone data, and greater smartphone usage during sleep time. While the observed associations were significant across the group, there was also significant variation between individuals.
Conclusions
The findings suggest that digital measures of speech disfluency may serve as scalable markers of conceptual disorganization. The findings warrant further investigation into the use of recorded interviews and passive sensing technologies to assist in the characterization and tracking of psychotic illness.}

In this paper, starting from a real case study, and thus the architectural and technological refurbishment of an Italian University building (Campobasso, South Italy, cold climate), with the aims of improving the classrooms’ quality and safety, a comprehensive approach for the retrofit design is proposed. By taking into account the necessary come back to classrooms starting, hopefully, from the next months (Autumn 2020), experimental studies (monitoring and investigations of the current energy performances) are followed by the coupling of different numerical methods of investigations, and thus building performance simulations, under transient conditions of heat transfer, and computational fluid dynamics studies, to evidence criticalities and potentialities to designers involved in the re-thinking of indoor spaces hosting multiple persons, with quite high occupancy patterns. Both energy impacts, in terms of monthly and annual increase of energy demands due to higher mechanical ventilation, and indoor distribution of microclimatic parameters (i.e., temperature, airspeed, age of air) are here investigated, by proposing new scenarios and evidencing the usefulness of HVAC systems, equipment (e.g., sensible heat recovery, without flows’ contamination) and suitability of some strategies for the air distribution systems (ceiling squared and linear slot diffusers) compared to traditional ones.}

By the method of cluster analysis, some empirical patterns regarding the students' programming learning with computational problem-solving were identified. Furthermore, comparisons of computational design and computational performance among the different patterns of computational practice were conducted.

abstract = {Cognition—sensing and responding to the environment—is the unifying principle behind the genetic code, origin of life, evolution, consciousness, artificial intelligence, and cancer. However, the conventional model of biology seems to mistake cause and effect. According to the reductionist view, the causal chain in biology is chemicals → code → cognition. Despite this prevailing view, there are no examples in the literature to show that the laws of physics and chemistry can produce codes, or that codes produce cognition. Chemicals are just the physical layer of any information system. In contrast, although examples of cognition generating codes and codes controlling chemicals are ubiquitous in biology and technology, cognition remains a mystery. Thus, the central question in biology is: What is the nature and origin of cognition? In order to elucidate this pivotal question, we must cultivate a deeper understanding of information flows. Through this lens, we see that biological cognition is volitional (i.e., deliberate, intentional, or knowing), and while technology is constrained by deductive logic, living things make choices and generate novel information using inductive logic. Information has been called “the hard problem of life’ and cannot be fully explained by known physical principles (Walker et al., 2017). The present paper uses information theory (the mathematical foundation of our digital age) and Turing machines (computers) to highlight inaccuracies in prevailing reductionist models of biology, and proposes that the correct causation sequence is cognition → code → chemicals.}

abstract = {Theory of Mind (ToM) is the ability to understand the perspectives, mental states and beliefs of others in order to anticipate their behaviour and is therefore crucial to social interactions. Although fMRI has been widely used to establish the neural networks implicated in ToM, little is known about the timing of ToM-related brain activity. We used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to measure the neural processes underlying ToM, as MEG provides very accurate timing and excellent spatial localization of brain processes. We recorded MEG activity during a false belief task, a reliable measure of ToM, in twenty young adults (10 females). MEG data were recorded in a 151 sensor CTF system (MISL, Coquitlam, BC) and data were co-registered to each participant's MRI (Siemens 3T) for source reconstruction. We found stronger right temporoparietal junction (rTPJ) activations in the false belief condition from 150ms to 225ms, in the right precuneus from 275ms to 375ms, in the right inferior frontal gyrus from 200ms to 300ms and the superior frontal gyrus from 300ms to 400ms. Our findings extend the literature by demonstrating the timing and duration of neural activity in the main regions involved in the “mentalizing” network, showing that activations related to false belief in adults are predominantly right lateralized and onset around 100ms. The sensitivity of MEG will allow us to determine spatial and temporal differences in the brain processes in ToM in younger populations or those who demonstrate deficits in this ability.}

abstract = {Gestures that spontaneously accompany speech convey information coordinated with the concurrent speech. There has been considerable theoretical disagreement about the process by which this informational coordination is achieved. Some theories predict that the information encoded in gesture is not influenced by how information is verbally expressed. However, others predict that gestures encode only what is encoded in speech. This paper investigates this issue by comparing informational coordination between speech and gesture across different languages. Narratives in Turkish, Japanese, and English were elicited using an animated cartoon as the stimulus. It was found that gestures used to express the same motion events were influenced simultaneously by (1) how features of motion events were expressed in each language, and (2) spatial information in the stimulus that was never verbalized. From this, it is concluded that gestures are generated from spatio-motoric processes that interact on-line with the speech production process. Through the interaction, spatio-motoric information to be expressed is packaged into chunks that are verbalizable within a processing unit for speech formulation. In addition, we propose a model of speech and gesture production as one of a class of frameworks that are compatible with the data.}

abstract = {Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (ChatGPT) has generated excitement and concern in education. While cross-sectional studies have highlighted correlations between ChatGPT use and learning performance, they fall short of establishing causality. This review examines experimental studies on ChatGPT's impact on student learning to address this gap. A comprehensive search across five databases identified 69 articles published between 2022 and 2024 for analysis. The findings reveal that ChatGPT interventions are predominantly implemented at the university level, cover various subject areas focusing on language education, are integrated into classroom environments as part of regular educational practices, and primarily involve direct student use of ChatGPT. Overall, ChatGPT improves academic performance, affective-motivational states, and higher-order thinking propensities; it reduces mental effort and has no significant effect on self-efficacy. However, methodological limitations, such as the lack of power analysis and concerns regarding post-intervention assessments, warrant cautious interpretation of results. This review presents four propositions from the findings: (1) distinguish between the quality of ChatGPT outputs and the positive effects of interventions on academic performance by shifting from well-defined problems in post-intervention assessments to more complex, project-based assessments that require skill demonstration, adopting proctored assessments, or incorporating metrics such as originality alongside quality; (2) evaluate long-term impacts to determine whether the positive effects on affective-motivational states are sustained or merely owing to novelty effect; (3) prioritise objective measures to complement subjective assessments of higher-order thinking; and (4) use power analysis to determine adequate sample sizes to avoid Type II errors and provide reliable effect size estimates. This review provides valuable insights for researchers, instructors, and policymakers evaluating the effectiveness of generative AI integration in educational practice.}

This paper proposes that image schemas can play an important role in computational concept invention, namely within the computational realisation of conceptual blending. We propose to build a library of formalised image schemas, and illustrate how they can guide the search for a base space in the concept invention work flow. Their schematic nature is captured by the idea of organising image schemas into families. Formally, they are represented as heterogeneous, interlinked theories.}
