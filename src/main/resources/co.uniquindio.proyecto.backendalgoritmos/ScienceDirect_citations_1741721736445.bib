abstract = {Having no native energy resources of fossil fuels, with poor wind resource and scarcity of land, the Solar Photovoltaic (PV) roadmap identified solar electricity as the most feasible source of renewable energy for Singapore's energy mix and supply. Moving towards net-zero emissions and to combat climate change, the Singapore government is aiming to achieve 2-Gigawatt-peak (GWp) of solar electricity target by 2030. Accordingly, the share of solar energy in the national grid is targeted to be between ∼2–6% in 2030 and ∼ 3.5–8% in 2040, and carbon emission savings to be ∼0.5–1.4 and ∼ 0.8–2.1 million tonnes per annum in 2030 and 2040 respectively. Although these ambitious targets align with the government's plans for mitigating emissions, Singapore faces great challenge in terms of land availability to install ground-mounted solar PV panels. In this paper, a system dynamics model is developed to study- to what extent can Singapore achieve the targeted solar electricity goals by 2030 or even beyond based on Green Plan 2030, what policies can be identified to achieve these targets, and how much carbon savings can be achieved through Solar electricity deployment. Accordingly, this paper presents systems thinking and system dynamics (ST&SD) methodology to model the growth of Singapore's solar capacity, carbon emission savings and share of electricity demand met by solar electricity while focusing on key complex factors such as area utilisation, subsidies, PV panel efficiency etc. Results of our model simulations and projections, based on the key data and assumptions, and policy scenarios show that Singapore's solar capacity can be accelerated by the implementation of the proposed policies to reach 2GWp goal towards 2030 or even slightly ahead of this timeline. However, should the government revise its solar capacity targets higher for the years past 2030 i.e. to achieve 8% share of total electricity generation, perhaps by 2040, policies such as an increased area utilisation, subsidies and higher panel efficiency need to be introduced. Our model simulations incorporating and evaluating these policy scenarios yielded the results aligning with the projections mentioned above. The results and insights presented in this paper offer useful recommendations to the researchers and policy makers in the field of solar electricity system in Singapore, and to study further for better policy making.}

This paper provides a background to the concepts, findings and methods of risk estimation that guided the field through the period of its growth to the beginning of the 21st century. It draws attention to several key facts: (a) thus far, genetic risk estimates have been made indirectly using mutation data collected in mouse radiation studies; (b) important uncertainties and unsolved problems remain, one notable example being that we still do not know the sensitivity of human female germ cells to radiation-induced mutations; and (c) the concept that dominated the field thus far, namely, that radiation exposures to germ cells can result in single gene diseases in the descendants of those exposed has been replaced by the concept that radiation exposure can cause DNA deletions, often involving more than one gene. Genetic risk estimation now encompasses work devoted to studies on DNA deletions induced in human germ cells, their expected frequencies, and phenotypes and associated clinical consequences in the progeny. We argue that the time is ripe to embark on a human genome-based, mechanism-driven, computational modeling of genetic risks of ionizing radiation, and we present a provisional framework for catalyzing research in the field in the 21st century.}

Eye tracker has portability, straightforward application, cost-effectiveness, and infant-friendly neuroimaging measures of cognitive processes such as attention, engagement, and learning. Furthermore, the ongoing software enhancements coupled with the implementation of artificial intelligence algorithms have improved the precision of collecting eye movement data and simplified the calibration process. These characteristics make it plausible to consider eye-tracking technology a promising tool to assist the teaching-learning process in school routines. However, eye tracking needs to be explored more as an educational instrument for real-time classroom activities and teachers' feedback. This perspective article briefly presents the fundamentals of the eye-tracking technique and four illustrative examples of employing this method in everyday school life. The first application shows how eye tracker information may contribute to teacher assessment of students' computational thinking in coding classes. In the second and third illustrations, we discuss the additional information provided by the eye-tracker to the teacher assessing the student's strategies to solve fraction problems and chart interpretation. The last illustration demonstrates the potential of eye tracking to provide Real-time feedback on learning difficulties/disabilities. Thus, we highlight the potential of the eye tracker as a complementary tool to promote personalized education and discuss future perspectives. In conclusion, we suggest that an eye-tracking system could be helpful by providing real-time student gaze leading to immediate teacher interventions and metacognition strategies.}

In fact, most of the practical applications involves non-conjugate models, thus approximate methods, such as the MCMC algorithms, are required. Although these methods can deal with quite complex structures, some practical problems can make their applications quite time demanding, for example, when we use heavy-tailed distributions, convergence may be difficult, also the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm can become very slow, in addition to the extra work inevitably required on choosing efficient candidate generator distributions. In this work, we draw attention to the special functions as a tools for Bayesian computation, we propose an alternative method for obtaining the posterior distribution in Gaussian non-conjugate models in an exact form. We use complex integration methods based on the H-function in order to obtain the posterior distribution and some of its posterior quantities in an explicit computable form. Two examples are provided in order to illustrate the theory.}

Participants were kindergarten and first grade students from the Midwestern United States. Initial correlations demonstrated significant positive relationships between students’ performance on the Torrance Test of Creative Thinking –Figural (TTCT-F) and static academic achievement scores in both reading and mathematics, but that same relationship did not exist with academic growth scores. Specifically, when academic growth was examined further using Generalized Additive Models (GAMs), a complex picture emerged, such that grade level (i.e., kindergarten v. first grade) and subscale type (e.g., Fluency v. Originality) influenced the significance and nature of the relationship (i.e., linear v. nonlinear). In general, as students increased in creativity performance, they demonstrated less academic growth. Future work should explore the underlying mechanisms explaining these relationships to better help students leverage their creative abilities for positive academic gains in the classroom setting.}

To overcome above issue, an evolutionary updating mechanism called Memory Backtracking Strategy (MBS) is proposed, which contains thinking stage, recall stage, and memory stage. Overall, the adoption of the MBS enhances the efficiency of MHSs by incorporating group memory, clue recall, and memory forgetting mechanisms. These strategies improve the algorithm's ability to explore the search space, optimize the search process, and escape local optima. MBS will be applied to three different types of MHS algorithms: evolutionary based (LSHADE_SPACMA), physical based (Stochastic Fractal Search, SFS), and biological based (Marine Predators Algorithmnm, MPA) to demonstrate the universality of MBS. In the experimental section including 57 engineering problems, algorithm complexity analysis, CEC2020 Friedman ranking, convergence curve, Wilcoxon statistical, and box plot. Among them, 21 algorithms participated in the Friedman experiment, including MBS_LSHADE_SPACMA ranked first, LSHADE_SPACMA ranked second, MBS_MPA ranked 6th, MPA ranked 8th, MBS_SFS ranked 9th and SFS ranked 12th. Combined with the analysis of "MBS testing analysis" and the experimental results of engineering problems, it has proven that MBS has universality and good ability to improve optimization algorithm performance.

The impact of this intervention on experiential learning amongst the students was then evaluated by analysing the feedback provided by voluntary participants during several focus group sessions. The feedback gave further insight into teaching pedagogy with respect to Kolb's experiential learning cycle. It was found the programming background of an individual clearly affects the phase of the learning cycle they predominantly experience during the workshops. Furthermore, programming background affected an individual's critical thinking while approaching an engineering problem. Constructive feedback provided by the student participants offered an invaluable opportunity for the teaching team to reflect on what went well and the areas for improvement in future iterations.

Molecular metal oxides often adopt common structural frameworks (i.e. archetypes), many of them boasting impressive structural robustness and stability. However, the ability to adapt and to undergo transformations between different structural archetypes is a desirable material design feature offering applicability in different environments. Using systems thinking approach that integrates synthetic, analytical and computational techniques, we explore the transformations governing the chemistry of polyoxovanadates (POVs) constructed of arsenate and vanadate building units. The water-soluble salt of the low nuclearity polyanion [V6As8O26]4− can be effectively used for the synthesis of the larger spherical (i.e. kegginoidal) mixed-valent [V12As8O40]4− precipitate, while the novel [V10As12O40]8− POVs having tubular cyclic structures are another, well soluble product. Surprisingly, in contrast to the common observation that high-nuclearity polyoxometalate (POM) clusters are fragmented to form smaller moieties in solution, the low nuclearity [V6As8O26]4− anion is in situ transformed into the higher nuclearity cluster anions. The obtained products support a conceptually new model that is outlined in this article and that describes a continuous evolution between spherical and cyclic POV assemblies. This new model represents a milestone on the way to rational and designable POV self-assemblies.}

As Malafouris (2015, p. 361) puts it, “cognition is not a within property; it is an in-between process”. Interactive processes configure extended systems within which each human agent is embedded. Yet much research on higher cognition, such as problem solving, reflects an implicit but deep commitment to methodological individualism that casts the agent as the ontological locus of cognition, and largely dictates the nature of the research enterprise. Thus, tasks to measure capacities and gauge reasoning performance are designed in a manner that reduces or eliminates the possibility of interacting with the problem presentation; if thinking takes place in the head, there is no need or reason to engineer procedures wherein agents can interact with the task's physical constituents. Conversely, a methodological interactivism forces one to acknowledge the participative yet not all-encompassing role of capacities such as working memory and thinking dispositions; it also encourages the granular mapping of the cognitive ecosystem from which new ideas emerge. To adopt an interactivist perspective is thus to focus on the cognitive resources of the extended system inviting a careful description of how these resources are dynamically configured over time and space to promote the development of new ideas in problem solving. In turn, a systemic perspective encourages the development of interventions that promote cognitive performance through the optimisation of systemic rather than individualist cognitive resources.}

This study presents two experiments exploring effects of attention during an isometric plantar-flexion task using surface electromyography (sEMG). Participants' attention was directed either externally (towards the force plate they were pushing against) or internally (towards their own leg, specifically the agonist muscle). Experiment 1 tested the effects of attention on accuracy and efficiency of force produced at three target forces (30, 60, and 100% of the maximum voluntary contraction; MVC). An internal focus of attention reduced the accuracy of force being produced and increased cocontraction of the antagonist muscle. Error on a given trial was positively correlated with the magnitude of cocontraction on that trial. Experiment 2 tested the effects of attention on muscular fatigue at 30, 60 and 100%MVC. An internal focus of attention led to less efficient intermuscular coordination, especially early in the contraction. These results suggest that an internal focus of attention disrupts efficient motor control in force production resulting in increased cocontraction, which potentially explains other neuromechanical findings (e.g. reduced functional variability with an internal focus).}

Addressing the challenge of ranking all alternatives based on a given criterion fuzzy concept is a novel research direction in the field of fuzzy multi-criteria ranking issues. This paper proposes a three-phase approach for multi-criteria ranking in fuzzy environments, which combines the criterion fuzzy concept and three-way decision thinking. The proposed approach not only analyzes the decision-making characteristics of all alternatives but also facilitates their ranking. During the first phase, a qualitative classification method based on the criterion fuzzy concept and ideal solutions is defined, which divides all alternatives into three independent decision sub-regions. During the second phase, by analyzing the priority relationships among the alternatives within every sub-region, three local ranking rules for alternatives are proposed to determine the ranking of alternatives in each classification region. During the third phase, the semantic relations among three classification regions are considered to give an overall ranking of all alternatives. Finally, combined with two existing quantitative ranking indicators, multiple data sets are employed to verify the feasibility and superiority of the proposed three-phase multi-criteria ranking approach.}

The relevance of design thinking and cognitive approaches to the development of pedagogical approaches in design education is presented and discussed. A conceptual model for design education that emphasizes the acquisition of explicit knowledge of design is proposed. The acquisition of knowledge is achieved through the explication of cognitive structures and strategies of design thinking. The explication process is constructed by exploiting a representational formalism, and a computational medium which supports both the learning process as well as the potential re-use of this knowledge. Finally, an argument is presented that the measure of learning, generally equated with the evaluation of the product of designing, can instead be based upon evaluating learning increments of acquired knowledge.}

abstract = {Sweden's pulp and paper sector accounts for a significant proportion of national energy usage, besides generating wastewater that causes eutrophication of nearby sinks. In this paper, the possibility of optimizing biological wastewater treatment at the Stora Enso Skoghall mill south of the city of Karlstad in central Sweden, with respect to electricity usage and the addition of nutrients, has been investigated. A computational model of the treatment process was developed, based on process data obtained from the said mill, and nine different scenarios were compared subsequently, with energy use, environmental impacts and operational expenses, as criteria. The most energy-efficient and cost-effective alternative was a combination of measures such as lowering the oxygen level in the MBBR (Moving Bed Bio-Reactor) from 3 mg/l to 2 mg/l and using the Hyperclassic aerator in the aerated lagoon. This arrangement yielded a 48.5 % reduction in operational expenses, and a 60 % decrease in the energy use, vis-à-vis the reference case, without affecting the efficiency of the treatment process. This also uncovered an opportunity to mitigate the annual global warming and eutrophication impacts, by approximately 100 tons CO2-eq. and 140 kg PO43−-eq. respectively. All attempts to optimise the use of resources and decrease the anthropogenic environmental footprint ought to be made to come closer to the targets set by the United Nations' sustainable development goals (SDGs). The authors' conclusion predicated on the results of the modelling and analysis done in this study is that the potential of seemingly small process modifications, such as lowering the oxygen level in the MBBR, and applying a more optimal dosage of nutrient salts, must not be overlooked by wastewater treatment plants in general (and those in pulp and paper mills in particular).}

Frequentist and Bayesian statistics represent two differing paradigms for the analysis of data. Frequentism became the dominant mode of statistical thinking in medical practice during the 20th century. The advent of modern computing has made Bayesian analysis increasingly accessible, enabling growing use of Bayesian methods in a range of disciplines, including medical research. Rather than conceiving of probability as the expected frequency of an event (purported to be measurable and objective), Bayesian thinking conceives of probability as a measure of strength of belief (an explicitly subjective concept). Bayesian analysis combines previous information (represented by a mathematical probability distribution, the prior) with information from the study (the likelihood function) to generate an updated probability distribution (the posterior) representing the information available for clinical decision making. Owing to its fundamentally different conception of probability, Bayesian statistics offers an intuitive, flexible, and informative approach that facilitates the design, analysis, and interpretation of clinical trials. In this Review, we provide a brief account of the philosophical and methodological differences between Bayesian and frequentist approaches and survey the use of Bayesian methods for the design and analysis of clinical research.}

Most of the proposals for price computation existing in the literature are concerned with short-term competitive equilibrium (generators should not be willing to change the dispatch assigned to them by the auctioneer), which implies operational-cost recovery for all of the generators accepted in the auction. However, this is in general not enough to choose between the different pricing schemes. We propose to include an additional criterion in order to discriminate among different pricing schemes: prices have to be also signals for generation expansion. Using this condition, we arrive to a single solution to the problem of defining prices, where they are computed as the shadow prices of the balance equations in a linear version of the unit commitment problem. Importantly, not every linearization of the unit commitment is valid; we develop the conditions for this linear model to provide adequate investment signals. Compared to other proposals in the literature, our results provide a strong motivation for the pricing scheme and a simple method for price computation.}

Anti-doping efforts have previously predominantly focused on athlete behaviours and sophisticated detection methods, however, doping issues remain. As such, there is merit in exploring an alternative approach. The aim of this study was to apply a systems thinking approach to model the current anti-doping system for four football codes in Australia, using the Systems Theoretic Accident Model and Processes (STAMP). The STAMP control structure was developed and validated by eighteen subject matter experts across a five-phase validation process. Within the developed model, education was identified as a prominent approach anti-doping authorities use to combat doping. Further, the model suggests that a majority of existing controls are reactive, and hence that there is potential to employ leading indicators to proactively prevent doping and that new incident reporting systems could be developed to capture such information. It is our contention that anti-doping research and practice should consider a shift away from the current reactive and reductionist approach of detection and enforcement to a proactive and systemic approach focused on leading indicators. This will provide anti-doping agencies a new lens to look at doping in sport.}

abstract = {Background
Physiochemical factors such as temperature, pH and cofactors are well known parameters that confer conformational changes in a protein structure. With S100β protein being a metal binding brain-specific receptor for both extracellular and intracellular functions, a change in conformation due to the above-mentioned factors, can compromise their cellular functions and therefore result in several pathological conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease, Ischemic stroke, as well as Myocardial Infarction.
Objective
The studies conducted sought to elucidate the effect of these physiological factors on the conformational dynamics of S100β protein using computational modeling approaches.
Method
Temperature-dependent and protein-cofactor complexes molecular dynamics simulations were conducted by varying the temperature from 100 to 400K using GROMACS 5.0.3. Additionally, the conformational dynamics of the protein was studied by varying the pH at 5.0, 7.4 and 9.0 using Ambertools17. This was done by preparing the protein molecule, solvating and minimizing its energy level as well as heating it to the required temperature, equilibrating and simulating under desired conditions (NVT and NPT ensembles).
Results
The results show that the protein misfolds as a function of increasing temperature with alpha helical content at 100K and 400K being 57.8% and 43.3%, respectively. However, the binding sites of the protein were not appreciably affected by temperature variations. The protein displayed high conformational instability in acidic medium (pH ~5.0). The binding sites of Ca2+, Mg2+ and Zn2+ were identified and each exhibited different groupings of the secondary structural elements (binding motifs). The secondary structure analysis revealed different conformational changes with the characteristic appearance of two beta hairpins in the presence of Zn2+and Mg2+.
Conclusion
High temperatures, different cofactors and acidic pH confer conformational changes to the S100β structure and these results may indicate the design of novel drugs against the protein.}

abstract = {In non-routine engineering design projects, the design outcome is determined by how the problem is formulated and represented in the early conceptual stage. The problem representation comprises schemas, ontologies, variables, and parameters relevant to the given problem class. Despite the critical role of early conceptual decisions in shaping the eventual design outcome, most of the computational support and automation are focused on the latter stages of parametric modelling, problem-solving, and optimization. There is inadequate support for aiding and automating problem formulation, variable and parameter identification and representation, and early-stage conceptual decisions. Therefore, this paper presents an innovative, transparent, and explainable method employing semantic reasoning to automate the step-by-step conceptual design generation process, including problem formulation, identification and representation of the variables and parameters and their dependencies. The method is realized through a novel framework called Knowledge Augmented Generalizer Specializer (KAGS). KAGS employs the Function-Behavior-Structure (FBS) ontology and the Graph-of-Thought (GoT) mechanism to enable automated reasoning with a Large Language Model (LLM). The workflow comprises various stages: problem breakdown, design prototype creation, assessment, and prototype merging. The framework is implemented and tested on a Subsea Layout (SSL) planning problem, a special class of infrastructure planning projects in deep-sea oil and gas production systems. The experimentations with KAGS demonstrate its capacity to support problem formulation, hierarchical decomposition, and solution generation. The research also provides new insights into the FBS framework and meta-level reasoning in early design stages.}

We study the algebraic structure of the computations carried out by Petri nets from the viewpoint of algebraic automata theory. Petri nets comprise a formalized graphical modeling language, often used to describe computation occurring within biochemical and genetic regulatory networks, but the semantics may be interpreted in different ways in the realm of automata. Therefore, there are several different ways to turn a Petri net into a state-transition automaton. Here, we systematically investigate different conversion methods and describe cases where they may yield radically different algebraic structures. We focus on the existence of group components of the corresponding transformation semigroups, as these reflect symmetries of the computation occurring within the biological system under study. Results are illustrated by applications to the Petri net modelling of intermediary metabolism. Petri nets with inhibition are shown to be computationally rich, regardless of the particular interpretation method. Along these lines we provide a mathematical argument suggesting a reason for the apparent all-pervasiveness of inhibitory connections in living systems.}

We explain fundamental notions of granular computing based on the philosophy of three-way decision as thinking in threes. We discuss a model of three-way granular computing by making use of two particular types of granular structures represented, respectively, by three granules and three levels. We use examples across different disciplines to demonstrate the values of the two types.

The phases of the PISM process include strategize, innovate, operationalize, and assess. We describe and demonstrate how each phase contributes to the overall goal of effective and sustainable intervention implementation.

We offer solutions such as innovative data collection methods and participatory model development to enhance the robustness and applicability of systems models. Through a case study on the development of a chronic disease prevention intervention, the paper illustrates the practical application of PISM and highlights its potential to guide epidemiologists and implementation scientists in developing interventions that are responsive to the complexities of real-world health systems. The conclusion calls for further research to refine participatory systems modeling techniques, overcome existing challenges in data availability, and expand the use of PISM in diverse public health contexts.}

This paper presents a Computational Knowledge Elicitation and Sharing System which attempts to elicit knowledge from individuals as well as a team and converts it into a structured format and shared among the team. The proposed system accomplishes several current technologies in knowledge-based system, artificial intelligence and natural language processing, which converts the narrative knowledge of knowledge workers into a concept mapping representation. With a sufficient number of narratives, patterns are revealed and an aggregate concept map for all participating members is produced. It converts the unstructured text into a more structured format which helps to summarize and share the knowledge that can be taken in handling different case management issues. Such integration is considered to be novel. A prototype system has been implemented based on the method successfully in the mental healthcare of a social service organization for handling their case management issues. An experiment has been carried out for measuring the accuracy for converting the unstructured data into the structured format. The theoretical results are found to agree well with the experimental results.}

The supplementary motor area (SMA) is believed to contribute to higher order aspects of motor control. We considered a key higher order role: tracking progress throughout an action. We propose that doing so requires population activity to display low "trajectory divergence": situations with different future motor outputs should be distinct, even when present motor output is identical. We examined neural activity in SMA and primary motor cortex (M1) as monkeys cycled various distances through a virtual environment. SMA exhibited multiple response features that were absent in M1. At the single-neuron level, these included ramping firing rates and cycle-specific responses. At the population level, they included a helical population-trajectory geometry with shifts in the occupied subspace as movement unfolded. These diverse features all served to reduce trajectory divergence, which was much lower in SMA versus M1. Analogous population-trajectory geometry, also with low divergence, naturally arose in networks trained to internally guide multi-cycle movement.}

Some of the research on creativity as of late involves the brain and biological correlates of originality, novelty, and insight. Handedness has long been used as an indication of hemispheric dominance or hemisphericity, with right-handed people being compared with left-handed people. There are several reports of left-handed persons outnumbering the right-handed ones in creative and eminent samples. Hemisphericity and other important brain structures and processes contributing to creative thinking and behavior have more recently been studied with electroencephalogram (EEG), positron emission topography (PET), cerebral blood flow, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques. Numerous EEG studies suggest that there are particular brain wave patterns and brain structures that are associated with creative problem-solving or at least with specific phases within the problem-solving process. EEGs suggest a complex kind of activity while individuals work on tasks indicative of creative potential. Much of the complexity disappears when those same individuals work on convergent thinking tasks. Research suggests that the prefrontal cortex plays an important role in creative thinking and behaviour.}

The B-SNIP consortium identified and validated more neurobiologically homogeneous psychosis Biotypes using an extensive battery of neurocognitive and psychophysiological laboratory measures. However, typically the first step in any diagnostic evaluation is the clinical interview. In this project, we evaluated if psychosis Biotypes have clinical characteristics that can support their differentiation in addition to obtaining laboratory testing. Clinical interview data from 1907 individuals with a psychosis Biotype were used to create a diagnostic algorithm. The features were 58 ratings from standard clinical scales. Extremely randomized tree algorithms were used to evaluate sensitivity, specificity, and overall classification success. Biotype classification accuracy peaked at 91 % with the use of 57 items on average. A reduced feature set of 28 items, though, also showed 81 % classification accuracy. Using this reduced item set, we found that only 10–11 items achieved a one-vs-all (Biotype-1 or not, Biotype-2 or not, Biotype-3 or not) area under the sensitivity-specificity curve of .78 to .81. The top clinical characteristics for differentiating psychosis Biotypes, in order of importance, were (i) difficulty in abstract thinking, (ii) multiple indicators of social functioning, (iii) conceptual disorganization, (iv) severity of hallucinations, (v) stereotyped thinking, (vi) suspiciousness, (vii) unusual thought content, (viii) lack of spontaneous speech, and (ix) severity of delusions. These features were remarkably different from those that differentiated DSM psychosis diagnoses. This low-burden adaptive algorithm achieved reasonable classification accuracy and will support Biotype-specific etiological and treatment investigations even in under-resourced clinical and research environments.}

The simulations are performed with a very wide computational domain (10 chord length) to minimize the influence of spanwise periodic boundary conditions. For the URANS simulations, four different spanwise mesh resolutions are tested to determine the minimum resolution required to capture the formation of stall cells. Both URANS and DDES results show a sudden decrease in lift and increase in drag between 16° and 17° angle of attack, accompanied by a significant change of separated flow patterns. Stall cell structures are observed clearly in the URANS solutions between 17° and 19° with a spanwise spacing of about 1.4 to 1.8 chord length, which agrees well with a theoretical prediction based on the slope of the lift curve in this angle-of-attack range. The DDES results show much more complex flow patterns over the airfoil at these high angles of attack, although the spectral analysis of wall shear stress suggests the existence of flow structures having a similar spanwise length scale to the stall cells.}

The measurement of these competencies in developmental samples has been of scientific interest. They have been recognized as having important implications for defining rational thinking in children and youth but also for teaching and training (such as, critical thinking in education). The origin of the theories and paradigms come from the adult literature, which has also undergone considerable progress in theoretical advancements and empirical studies over the last several years. The integration of our understanding from the work conducted in adults with consideration of developmental factors provides a way to advance our understanding of judgment and decision-making in children and youth. To accomplish this, establishing stimulus equivalence will be important given that these paradigms were first designed for adult samples. In addition, taking into account the rapid growth and change in cognitive capacities, that happen in development, are central for understanding performance on these paradigms. Using a working taxonomy of rational thinking based on adult samples, data from a longitudinal developmental study were used to empirically examine performance patterns on these paradigms.}

abstract = {To ensure service continuity in networks, local protection pre-configuring the backup paths is preferred to global protection. Under the practical hypothesis of single physical failures in the network, the backup paths which protect against different logical failure risks (node, link and shared risk link group (SRLG)) cannot be active at the same time. Thus, sharing bandwidth between such backup paths is crucial to increase the bandwidth availability. In this article, we focus on the optimal on-line distributed computation of the bandwidth-guaranteed backup paths in MPLS networks. As the requests for connection establishment and release arrive dynamically without knowledge of future arrivals, we choose to use the on-line mode to avoid LSP reconfigurations. We also selected a distributed computation to offer scalability and decrease the LSP setup time. Finally, the optimization of bandwidth utilization can be achieved thanks to the flexibility of the path choice offered by MPLS and to the bandwidth sharing. For a good bandwidth sharing, the backup path computation entities (BPCEs) require the knowledge and maintenance of a great quantity of bandwidth information (e.g. non aggregated link information or per path information) which is undesirable in distributed environments. To get around this problem, we propose here a PLR (point of local repair)-based heuristic (PLRH) which aggregates and noticeably decreases the size of the bandwidth information advertised in the network while offering a high bandwidth sharing. PLRH permits an efficient computation of backup paths. It is scalable, easy to be deployed and balances equitably computations on the network nodes. Simulations show that with the transmission of a small quantity of aggregated information per link, the ratio of rejected backup paths is low and close to the optimum.}

In this paper, micro-tab device attached to the pressure side of the flap surface is envisioned as a mean to achieve this goal. Hybrid method involving Computational Fluid Dynamics and acoustic analogy was used to predict the far-field noise spectrum. Results illustrate that the micro-tab device with reduced deflection angles of the high-lift settings provides lower noise signature at far-field positions, comparing to the baseline configuration, while the aerodynamic performance is maintained.

Conscious mental processes are achieved through a correct flow of information within and across neocortical networks, whose particular activity state results from a tight balance between excitation and inhibition. The proper equilibrium between these indissoluble forces is operated with multiscale organization: along the dendro–somatic axis of single neurons and at the network level. Fast synaptic inhibition is assured by a multitude of inhibitory interneurons. During cortical activities, these cells operate a finely tuned division of labor that is epitomized by their detailed connectivity scheme. Recent results combining the use of mouse genetics, cutting-edge optical and neurophysiological approaches have highlighted the role of fast synaptic inhibition in driving cognition-related activity through a canonical cortical circuit, involving several major interneuron subtypes and principal neurons. Here we detail the organization of this cortical blueprint and we highlight the crucial role played by different neuron types in fundamental cortical computations. In addition, we argue that this canonical circuit is prone to many variations on the theme, depending on the resolution of the classification of neuronal types, and the cortical area investigated. Finally, we discuss how specific alterations of distinct inhibitory circuits can underlie several devastating brain diseases.}

Most of these problems are complicated since various factors and their complicated relationships are involved. Success of this decision making relies on efficient business analytics based on the comprehensive and multi-dimensional data related to the static attributes and dynamic operations of the network. To confront the challenges, this paper proposes to explore a methodology of data-driven decision making for supply chain networks. In this methodology, a data-granularity model of a supply chain network is developed to standardize the data form for decision making. A four-dimensional-flow model of a supply chain network is proposed to satisfy the data requirements for decision making that are defined in the data-granularity model. Agent-based computational experiment is employed to support the generation of a comprehensive operational dataset of a supply chain network and to verify the solutions generated in decision making. Integrating these models, a data-driven decision-making framework for supply chain networks is proposed. In the framework, a new decision-making mode of “problem definition - business analytics - solution verification - parameter adjustment” is proposed. Oriented towards domain knowledge in supply chain networks, two approaches of business analytics—mapping analysis and correlation analysis—are presented. Finally, a case of a five-echelon manufacturing supply chain network is studied with the methodology. The findings indicate that the proposed methodology, models and framework are effective in supporting the data-centric decision making for solving complicated operational problems in supply chain networks and provide the networks’ managers or member enterprises with an effective tool to generate unbiased and efficient decisions for the networks’ performance improvement.}

This research has emphasized the reciprocal nature of the interactions between emotion and autobiographical memory: Not only do emotions influence memory, memories influence emotions. Next, we discuss advances that have been made in understanding the reciprocal relations between stress, mood, and autobiographical memory. Finally, we discuss the research that is situating emotional autobiographical memories within a social framework, providing a bedrock for collective memories.

abstract = {The storage capacity and the computation time of dynamic analysis for seismic responses of high concrete arch dam systems are enormous. As a matter of course, the use of high-performance parallel computation for seismic analysis of high-concrete dams must be enforced. The significance and current situation of parallel computation for hydraulic structures using finite element method are briefly described. However, the more difficult task is to develop a parallel program. The EFPG is a finite element program generator using finite element language developed by Chinese Professor Liang Guoping in 1990. The program generated by FEPG can be automatically transformed to corresponding parallel program through the program PFEPG. The parallel computational program by means of FEPG and PFEPG applied in this stage to dynamic analysis for seismic responses of high concrete arch dam system is outlined. The strategy of FEPG is based on component technique and the technique of automatically generating programs. According to the characteristics of domain decomposition method, a finite element program can generally be decomposed to six modules as preprocess partition, start, bft, solv, E, and U programs, in which the subroutines of E and U component are generated by the system based on the scripts VDE or PDE of the partial differential equation describing the physical fields and the corresponding computational algorithms (NFE), other else components are fixed and provided by the FEPG Library. The structures and modules as well as the working operation of FEPG and PFEPG are briefly introduced. The parallel program developed for seismic response analysis of high arch dam by using the FEPG and PFEPG, including the corresponding treatments of dynamic explicit computation process, dynamic contact problem, artificial transmitting, and spring-viscous boundaries, are examined in slight details. The procedure of seismic analysis of arch dam includes three loading cases accomplished successively as follows:1.In case 1, the dam elements were treated as dead elements with zero degree of freedom for nodes, and only the dead load of the foundation rock is considered in the analysis. At the end of calculation, the initial normal compressive force along the contact planes was modified by adding the calculated contact force. All other states of the foundation were recovered to that before loading.2.In case 2, the dead load of dam and other static actions including water pressure, silt pressure, and temperature applied to the dam as well as the seepage pressure in the foundation are considered.3.In case 3, a three-component seismic input is applied to the base of the artificial transmitting boundaries in form of displacement ground motion, or to the spring-viscous boundaries with free field input including boundary stresses, velocities and displacements. In this loading case, the rate effect for dynamic strength and modulus of elasticity are considered.}

abstract = {A standing challenge for the science of mind is to account for the datum that every mind faces in the most immediate – that is, unmediated – fashion: its phenomenal experience. The complementary tasks of explaining what it means for a system to give rise to experience and what constitutes the content of experience (qualia) in computational terms are particularly challenging, given the multiple realizability of computation. In this paper, we identify a set of conditions that a computational theory must satisfy for it to constitute not just a sufficient but a necessary, and therefore naturalistic and intrinsic, explanation of qualia. We show that a common assumption behind many neurocomputational theories of the mind, according to which mind states can be formalized solely in terms of instantaneous vectors of activities of representational units such as neurons, does not meet the requisite conditions, in part because it relies on inactive units to shape presently experienced qualia and implies a homogeneous representation space, which is devoid of intrinsic structure. We then sketch a naturalistic computational theory of qualia, which posits that experience is realized by dynamical activity-space trajectories (rather than points) and that its richness is measured by the representational capacity of the trajectory space in which it unfolds.}

The study is presented as a counterexample to deficit views of ASD, views that focus on lack of communication skills, not being able to see someone else’s point of view, and poor executive functions. Each encounter with the student is analyzed in two ways, first analyzing his mathematical knowledge, and then analyzing obstacles the student faces that are associated with ASD. Some obstacles are overcome by the student on his own and others are overcome with the help of the researcher, who responds to the student’s thinking, and supports his endeavor to engage with a challenging activity.}

A closely related discipline (considered usually a part of PSE) is the Computer Aided Process Engineering (CAPE) which is a complementary field that focuses on developing methods and providing solution through systematic computer aided techniques for problems related to the design, control and operation of chemical systems. Nowadays, the ‘PSE’ term suffers from a branding issue to the point that PSE no longer gets the recognition that it deserves. In chemical engineering education the integrative systems frame for process design, control and operations is virtually absent. Its application potential in process industry lags relative to academic research progress and results. This work aims to provide an informative industrial and academic perspective on PSE (focused on the European region), arguing that the ‘systems thinking’ and ‘systems problem solving’ have to be given priority over just applications of computational problem solving methods. A multi-level view of the PSE field is provided within the academic and industrial context, and enhancements for PSE are suggested at their industrial and academic interfaces to create win-win situations.}

The effectiveness of the proposed method hinges on three novelties: (i) the proposed relaxation is computationally efficient and provides an optimal solution most of the time, (ii) if the relaxation produces an infeasible solution, then this solution yields a tight lower bound for the optimal cost, and (iii) it can be modified easily to obtain a feasible solution, which yields an upper bound. In case of infeasibility, the relaxation approach is implemented at each node of the search tree in a branch-and-bound procedure to efficiently search for an optimal solution. Extensive numerical tests show that our method dominates the MIP solution approach and can handle real-life size problems in trivial time.}

Therefore, CFD simulation is a crucial asset to understand the influence of parameters of interest in these processes and related operation and optimization of the technology involved.

abstract = {Trace exploration is concerned with techniques that allow computation traces to be dynamically searched for specific contents. Depending on whether the exploration is carried backward or forward, trace exploration techniques allow provenance tracking or impact tracking to be done. The aim of provenance tracking is to show how (parts of) a program output depends on (parts of) its input and to help estimate which input data need to be modified to accomplish a change in the outcome. The aim of impact tracking is to identify the scope and potential consequences of changing the program input. Rewriting Logic (RWL) is a logic of change that supplements (an extension of) the equational logic by adding rewrite rules that are used to describe (nondeterministic) transitions between states. In this paper, we present a rich and highly dynamic, parameterized technique for the forward inspection of RWL computations that allows the nondeterministic execution of a given conditional rewrite theory to be followed up in different ways. With this technique, an analyst can browse, slice, filter, or search the traces as they come to life during the program execution. The navigation of the trace is driven by a user-defined, inspection criterion that specifies the required exploration mode. By selecting different inspection criteria, one can automatically derive a family of practical algorithms such as program steppers and more sophisticated dynamic trace slicers that compute summaries of the computation tree, thereby facilitating the dynamic detection of control and data dependencies across the tree. Our methodology, which is implemented in the Anima graphical tool, allows users to evaluate the effects of a given statement or instruction in isolation, track input change impact, and gain insight into program behavior (or misbehavior).}

In this work, we performed data mining of TF–glycogene relationships from the Cistrome Cancer database (DB), which integrates chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq) and RNA-Seq data to constitute regulatory relationships. In total, we observed 22,654 potentially significant TF–glycogene relationships, which include interactions involving 526 unique TFs and 341 glycogenes that span 29 the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cancer types. Here, TF–glycogene interactions appeared in clusters or so-called communities, suggesting that changes in single TF expression during both health and disease may affect multiple carbohydrate structures. Upon applying the Fisher’s exact test along with glycogene pathway classification, we identified TFs that may specifically regulate the biosynthesis of individual glycan types. Integration with Reactome DB knowledge provided an avenue to relate cell-signaling pathways to TFs and cellular glycosylation state. Whereas analysis results are presented for all 29 cancer types, specific focus is placed on human luminal and basal breast cancer disease progression. Overall, the article presents a computational approach to describe TF–glycogene relationships, the starting point for experimental system-wide validation.}

Utilizing the data from 139 interventions and 375 effect sizes, we found (a) a strong effect of learning computer programming per se (Hedges’ g‾ = 0.81, 95% CI [0.42, 1.21]), (b) moderate to large effect sizes of visualization (g‾ = 0.44, 95% CI [0.29, 0.58]) and physicality interventions (g‾ = 0.72, 95% CI [0.23, 1.21]), and (c) moderate to large effect sizes for studies focusing on dominant instructional approaches (g‾s = 0.49–1.02). Moderator analyses indicated that the effect sizes differed only marginally between the instructional approaches and conditions—however, collaboration in metacognition instruction, problem solving instruction outside of regular lessons, short-term interventions focusing on physicality, and interventions focusing on visualization through Scratch were especially effective.

Rescaling the smart city to the local urban precinct scale and paying close attention to life-technology relations is further reasoned as a way to productively re-orient and extend thinking on the ethical significance of the smart city.}

Motivated by the need for quantitative computer modeling and simulation of human decision processes in various application domains, including medicine, we have developed a general-purpose computational fuzzy RPD model that utilizes fuzzy sets, fuzzy rules, and fuzzy reasoning to represent, interpret, and compute imprecise and subjective information in every aspect of the model. Experiences acquired by solicitation with experts are stored in experience knowledge bases. New local and global similarity measures have been developed to identify the experience that is most applicable to the current situation in a specific decision-making context. Furthermore, an action evaluation strategy has been developed to select the workable course of action. The proposed fuzzy RPD model has been preliminarily validated by using it to calculate the extent of causality between a drug (Cisapride, withdrawn by the FDA from the market in 2000) and some of its adverse effects for 100 hypothetical patients. The simulated patients were created based on the profiles of over 1000 actual patients treated with the drug at our medical center before its withdrawal. The model validity was demonstrated by comparing the decisions made by the proposed model and those by two independent internists. The levels of agreement were established by the weighted Kappa statistic and the results suggested good to excellent agreement.}

The focus of the discussion was Indigenous design for adaptation to climate change in Moananui Oceania with an emphasis on relationships to nature. Given the diversity of Moananui Oceania in terms of languages, cultures, histories, and worldviews, this discussion represented a unique convergence of Indigenous leadership and thought in the field. It highlighted key themes related to Indigenous design for climate change adaptation and offered a novel, distinctive perspective aimed at advancing thinking around nature-based solutions (NbS). It is important to recognise and integrate Indigenous values and approaches to knowledge generation, particularly within academic settings. In the context of Moananui Oceania this can require adapting oral traditions and formats, such as talanoa, and hui or kōrero, into conventional Western-based research formats such as the journal article. This paper is an attempt to capture important Indigenous knowledge and discussion in a western format to enable further dissemination and sharing. This means the format and methodologies described in the paper do not align exactly with traditional scientific journal article formats, however the discussions and findings help to meet the motivation of the authors, which is to transform traditional Indigenous ways of sharing information into a perspective article format and share insights with a wider audience. This methodology aligns well with the special issue call that this paper resides in (Just, Socio-ecological Urban Transformation: Nature-based Solutions and Traditional Ecological Knowledge), underpinning the relevance and potential contribution to the field. Two key themes were explored within the context of the importance of working with nature; relationships between ecologies and tikanga (customary practices), and looking backwards to generate innovation and resilience.}

The subsequent emphasis has been placed on effective learning for agricultural managers and their technologist advisors. It is argued that problem solving and learning are essentially the same psychological processes and that taking a systems approach to investigating problem situations provides a more useful paradigm for learning about agriculture than reductionist, discipline-based approaches. Experiential learning and autonomy in learning are seen as consistent with this and are basic features of the programmes. A conceptual framework for problem solving that incorporates soft and hard systems and scientific reductionist methodologies has been developed. A contingency approach to situation improving is emerging as a less restrictive and more realistic alternative to a normative approach to problem solving.}

In particular, we illustrate that fragment-based approaches can be particularly suited for polypharmacology, owing to the inherent promiscuous nature of fragments. In parallel, we explain how computer-assisted protocols can provide invaluable insights into how to unveil compounds theoretically able to bind to more than one protein. Furthermore, several pragmatic aspects related to the use of these approaches are covered, thus offering the reader practical insights on multitarget-oriented drug discovery projects.}

In parallel, significant advances have occurred in precision medicine, utilizing breakthroughs in “omics biology,” coupled with our understanding of their impact across systems in “systems biology.” Contemporaneously, a new approach to thinking of how health and disease evolve and impact an individual has emerged—that of considering mechanisms and impact across scales, i.e. on a “multi-scale” level, extending from the patient down to the molecule, and similarly from the patient up to society. In this chapter details of each of these approaches, their evolution and key current concepts are outlined. Moreover, the main theme and postulate developed in this chapter outlines the interconnectedness and the way in which each approach informs each other. In essence a cyclic, reinforcing, feedback loop exists, connecting digital technologies with precision and personalization approaches, across systems and scales, leading to enhanced diagnostics, the potential for new therapeutics and increasing insight into mechanisms. This cyclic flow of information will lead to new, more exacting technologies, with the ultimate outcome of enhanced efficacy, safety and improved health outcomes for patients and society.}

The convenience of navigating personalized content comes with the notorious “filter bubble” effect, which can reduce exposure to diverse options and opinions. Children are particularly vulnerable to this due to their limited AI literacy and critical thinking skills. In this study, we explore how to engage children as co-designers to create child-centered experiences for learning AI concepts related to the filter bubble. Leveraging embodied and analogical learning theories, we co-designed an Augmented Reality (AR) application, BeeTrap, with children from underrepresented backgrounds in STEM. BeeTrap not only raises awareness of filter bubbles but also empowers children to understand recommendation system mechanisms. Our contributions include (1) insights into child-centered AI learning using embodied metaphors and analogies as educational representations of AI concepts; and (2) implications for enhancing children’s understanding of AI concepts through co-design processes.}

The revelation principle fails for level-k models, so restricting attention to direct mechanisms and imposing incentive-compatibility are not without loss of generality. If, however, only direct, level-k-incentive-compatible mechanisms are feasible and traders' levels are observable, Myerson and Satterthwaite's characterization of mechanisms that maximize traders' total surplus subject to incentive constraints generalizes qualitatively to level-k models. If only direct, level-k-incentive-compatible mechanisms are feasible but traders' levels are not observable, generically a particular posted-price mechanism maximizes traders' total expected surplus subject to incentive constraints. If direct, non-level-k-incentive-compatible mechanisms are feasible and traders best respond to them, total expected surplus-maximizing mechanisms may take completely different forms.}

Fault diagnosis is of great significance for realizing safe operations for industrial robots. However, it is difficult to obtain faulty data in real applications. To migrate this issue, a generative adversarial one-shot diagnosis (GAOSD) approach is proposed to diagnose robot transmission faults with only one sample per faulty pattern. Signals representing kinematical characteristics were acquired by an attitude sensor. A bidirectional generative adversarial network (Bi-GAN) was then trained using healthy signals. Inspired by way of human thinking, the trained encoder in Bi-GAN was taken out to perform information abstraction for all signals. Finally, the abstracted signals were sent to a random forest for the one-shot diagnosis. The performance of the present technique was evaluated on an industrial robot experimental setup. Experimental results show that the proposed GAOSD has promising performance on the fault diagnosis of robot transmission systems.}

Attempts to model such relationships often neglect indirect mechanisms by which flow influences fish. For example, growth of salmon juveniles is measurably faster when flows inundate floodplain and promote higher production of invertebrate prey, but out-of-channel flows have not yet been incorporated into models. The QUANTUS model developed here represents indirect linkages between flow and freshwater survival, mediated by temperature and prey availability, for fall Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). Quantiles of spawning time and place were used to define cohorts of salmon in a regulated Central Valley, California river. Survival of these quantile-cohorts was simulated through incubation, juvenile growth, and eventual downstream migration. A genetic algorithm was used to optimize the seasonal timing of pulse flows. Simulated survival was highest for flow regimes that provided a modest, temperature-moderating pulse flow in early summer and, for wetter years, a second, larger pulse of over-bank flow in late winter. For many rivers of the Pacific coast that support fall Chinook salmon, the thermal window of opportunity for spawning and rearing is narrow. Optimized flows made the most of this window by providing access to accelerated juvenile growth and early survival in floodplain habitat, a result that should be verified with field experiments. Timing of optimized pulse flows differed in some respects from the region's natural hydrograph, dominated by spring runoff. This suggests that understanding the mechanisms by which flow influences fishes can be important when shaping flows in the changed context of a regulated river.}

They are material independent methods that simply follow the trend of the available data, in each case giving the best estimate of their behavior.

We develop the hypothesis that chronic thinking associated with strong emotional arousal during meditation practice might be detrimental to meditation practice and well-being. One goal of meditation is to identify the arousal of emotions and thoughts, and remain equanimous with them. Over time, meditation may help dampen the attention-grabbing power of these thoughts both during practice and in daily life, which may consequently help deepen meditation practice. However, when meditators fail to remain equanimous, the effects of these thoughts may be deleterious. We discuss how this hypothesis may help guide future research on meditation.}

By modern electron-microscopy techniques, one can count the number of atoms laying on a line representing, e.g., an X-ray. The so obtained data is used in the integer programming formulation. However, in real applications the size of the problem, that is well-known to be NP-hard, is so large that no method seems to be applicable to it. Other natural restrictions can make the problem even harder. In an attempt to avoid such kind of difficulties, we present an alternative approach to the problem. With this, we also aim to shed more light on the theoretical limitations for efficient computation in Discrete Tomography. Our approach is based on image reconstruction from a single projection, under the hypothesis that all computations take place in an algebraic computation model. In terms of computational efficiency, the proposed algorithm is significantly superior to the known algorithms for the problem. We also discuss on the possibilities for practical implementation of our method.}

It is part of the main axis of the basal ganglia (BG) that connects the thalamo-cortical networks to the BG input stages (striatum and subthalamic nucleus) and continues directly, and indirectly through the GPe, to the BG output stages (GPi and substantia nigra reticulata). Here we review the unique anatomical and physiological features of the pallidal complex and argue that they support the main computational goal of the BG main axis (actor); namely, a behavioral policy that maximizes future cumulative gains and minimizes costs. The three mono-layer competitive networks of the BG main axis flexibly extract relevant features from the current state of the thalamo-cortical activity to control current (ongoing) and future actions. We hypothesize that the striatal and the subthalamic projections neurons act as mono-stable integrators (class I excitability) and the in-vivo pallidal neurons act as bi-stable resonators (class II excitability). GPe neurons exhibit pausing behavior because their membrane potential lingers in the vicinity of an unstable equilibrium point and bi-stability, and these pauses enable a less-greedy exploratory behavioral policy. Finally, degeneration of midbrain dopaminergic neurons and striatal dopamine depletion (as in Parkinson's disease) lead to augmentation of striatal excitability and competitive dynamics. As a consequence the pallidal network, whose elements tend to synchronize as a result of their bi-stable resonance behavior, shifts from a Poissonian-like non-correlated to synchronous oscillatory discharge mode.

This information is frequently robust or even difficult to get. Here, we exhibit a model of quantitative fuzzy rational demonstrating approach that can adapt to obscure motor information and hence deliver applicable results despite the fact that dynamic information is fragmented or just dubiously characterized. Besides, the methodology can be utilized as a part of the blend with the current cutting edge quantitative demonstrating strategies just in specific parts of the framework, i.e., where the data are absent. The contextual analysis of the methodology suggested in this paper is performed on the model of nine-quality genes.

One of the early versions is the extended Hückel method that begins with the approach used in the Hückel method, but with the overlap and exchange integrals (approximated by the Wolfsberg-Helmholtz, Ballhausen-Gray, or Cusachs' method) included. A more robust type of calculation is that in which an electron is presumed to move in a field generated by the nucleus and other electrons. A trial wave function with some adjustable parameter(s) is taken, and the energy calculated. The wave function improves and the calculations continue until there is no additional improvement (i.e., a “self-consistent field” has been obtained). There are numerous variations of this approach that differ in the trial wave function chosen, extent of electron-electron interaction included, etc. Density functional theory is a newer approach that uses less computational capacity. These types of molecular orbital calculations are surveyed briefly in this chapter.}

Vision is widely used as a model system to gain insights into how sensory inputs are processed and interpreted by the brain. Historically, careful quantification and control of visual stimuli have served as the backbone of visual neuroscience. There has been less emphasis, however, on how an observer’s task influences the processing of sensory inputs. Motivated by diverse observations of task-dependent activity in the visual system, we propose a framework for thinking about tasks, their role in sensory processing, and how we might formally incorporate tasks into our models of vision.}

abstract = {We develop a theory based on the evidence reported in Hare et al. (2009) to explain consumption of goods that feature a low-order attribute (e.g., taste) and a high-order attribute (e.g., health). One brain system with access to the low-order attribute computes the goal value of consumption while another brain system can modulate this value, at a cost, by transmitting information regarding the high-order attribute. We determine the optimal modulation and consumption strategy as a function of the cost of information transmission and the environment. We show that in healthy environments, modulation is used to signal surprisingly unhealthy goods so as to trigger abstinence when consumption would ordinarily occur. Conversely, in unhealthy environments, modulation is used to signal surprisingly healthy choices so as to trigger consumption when abstinence would ordinarily occur. From an outside perspective, individuals may appear to under-regulate their choices (self-indulgence) but also to over-regulate them (self-restraint). Both modulation and decisions are affected by factors orthogonal to the decision problem. In particular, taxing executive functions results in less modulation and more inefficient behavior. Finally, the model can shed light on issues related to eating disorders, present-biased preferences, habit formation and compulsive behavior.}

abstract = {Beginning with a reconstruction of the anthropological paradigms underlying The Vienna Manifesto and The Onlife Manifesto (§ 1.1), this paper distinguishes between two possible approaches to digital humanism: an extroverted one, principally engaged in finding a way to humanize digital technologies, and an introverted one, pointing instead attention to how digital technologies can re-humanize us, particularly our “mindframe” (§ 1.2). On this basis, I stress that if we take seriously the consequences of the “mediatic turn”, according to which human reason is finally recognized as mediatically contingent (§ 2.1), then we should accept that just as the book created the poietic context for the development of traditional humanism and its “bookish” idea of private and public reason, so too digital psycho-technologies today provide the conditions for the rise of a new humanism (§ 2.2). I then discuss the possible humanizing potential of digital simulated worlds: I compare the symbolic-reconstructive mindset to the sensorimotor mindset (§ 3.1), and I highlight their respective mediological association with the book and the video game, advocating for the peculiar thinking and reasoning affordances now offered by the new digital psycho-technologies (§ 3.2).}

In particular, adoptive T cell therapy has recently reached a major milestone with two products approved by the US FDA. However, the inherent complexity of cell-based immunotherapies means that their manufacturing time, cost, and controllability limit their effectiveness and geographic reach. One way to address these issues may lie in complementing the dominant, reductionistic mentality in modern medicine with complex systems thinking. In this opinion article, we identify key concepts from complexity theory to address manufacturing challenges in cell-based immunotherapies and raise the possibility of a unifying framework upon which future bioprocessing strategies may be designed.}

Models can help address key questions about the measurement, definition and function of proteomic networks. Here, we place these biological questions at the forefront in reviewing the computational strategies that are available to analyze proteomic networks. Recent examples illustrate how models can extract more information from proteomic data, test possible interactions between network proteins and link networks to cellular behavior. No single model can achieve all these goals, however, which is why it is critical to prioritize biological questions before specifying a particular modeling approach.}

While typically implemented in rigid silicon, emerging technologies in organic and flexible electronic materials have also led to tremendous advances in the development of neuromorphic perception systems. However, a comprehensive review of the contribution/role of organic neuromorphic electronics for robotic applications is still missing. This review presents advancements in silicon-based and organic neuromorphic electronics for intelligent robot development, focusing on perception, navigation, and learning-based control. Organic synaptic devices, along with dynamic vision sensors, enable diverse forms of sensory-enabled computational perception, offering tunability, stability, low power consumption, and conformal substrates. Integration of simultaneous localization and mapping techniques and path planning algorithms empowers robots to efficiently navigate, build accurate maps, and make informed decisions. Different learning algorithms and their hardware implementations in neuromorphic robotic control are explored, enabling robots to learn and adapt to dynamic environments. The review highlights the potential of neuromorphic electronics for sensing, thinking, and acting in advanced robotic systems. Organic, inorganic, and hybrid materials are discussed for implementing perception, navigation, and control in robots. Future research directions in the field are outlined. Leveraging various neuromorphic electronics unlocks the full potential of intelligent robotic systems for diverse applications.}

The move from the classical AI to CI indicates a continuation of the legacy of Herbert Simon. Computational intelligence has proved to be a constructive foundation for economics. In responding to what Herbert Simon referred as procedural rationality, our study of bounded rationality has been enriched by bringing autonomous agents into the economic analysis.}

We present recent efforts to address these challenges, both with artistic approaches to depicting the cellular mesoscale, and development and application of methods to build quantitative models.}
