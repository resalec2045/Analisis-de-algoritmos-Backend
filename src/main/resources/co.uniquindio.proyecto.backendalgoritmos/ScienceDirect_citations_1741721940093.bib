Superintelligence explores the future of artificial intelligence and related technologies and the risks they may pose to human civilization. The book ably demonstrates the potential for serious thinking aimed at the long-term future. Bostrom succeeds in arguing that the development of superintelligent machines will, if not properly managed, create catastrophic risks to humanity. The book falls short in some respects, and some sections are more compelling and novel than others. Overall, however, Bostrom’s book succeeds in demolishing the “null hypothesis” according to which the possibility and risks of superintelligence can continue to be ignored, and is a must-read for those interested in the long-term future of humanity.}

The complex interaction among contemporary techno- and socio-economic processes has set the stage for the emergence of a cyber-physical universe, the novel landscape in which agents behave and interact, and which is centered on the fundamental role played by information and computation at all levels. In this paper, we weave into a single analysis the different threads that lead to (and characterize) the cyber-physical universe and outline a map of its building blocks and the complex dynamics at work in the new environment. The resulting description is used to assess how decision-making processes should evolve in order to be able to address the opportunities and challenges of the current era of deep and extended changes. The analysis offers an encompassing interpretative grid to understand and unpack patterns in the contemporary socio-technical systems that experience a fundamental informational turn; this can inform new research trajectories and help open up new areas for scientific inquiry.}

abstract = {Air handling unit (AHU) is one of the most extensively used equipment in large commercial buildings. This device is typically customized and lacks quality system integration which can result in hardwire failures and control errors. Air handling unit Performance Assessment Rules (APAR) is a fault detection tool that uses a set of expert rules derived from mass and energy balances to detect faults in air handling units. APAR is computationally simple enough that it can be embedded in commercial building automation and control systems and relies only upon sensor data and control signals that are commonly available in these systems. Although APAR has advantages over other methods, for example no training data required and easy to implement commercially, most of the time it is unable to provide the root diagnosis of the faults. For instance, a fault on temperature sensor could be bias, drifting bias, inappropriate location, or complete failure. In addition a fault in mixing box can be return and/or outdoor damper leak or stuck. In addition, when multiple rules are satisfied, the list of faults increases. There is no proper way to have the correct diagnosis for rule based fault detection system. To overcome this limitation, we proposed Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) as a diagnostic tool. BBN can be used to simulate diagnostic thinking of FDD experts through a probabilistic way. In this study we developed a new way to detect and diagnose faults in AHU through combining APAR rules and Bayesian Belief network. Bayesian Belief Network is used as a decision support tool for rule based expert system. BBN is highly capable to prioritize faults when multiple rules are satisfied simultaneously. Also it can get information from previous AHU operating conditions and maintenance records to provide proper diagnosis. The proposed model is validated with real time measured data of a campus building. The results show that BBN correctly prioritize faults that are verified by manual investigation.}

The degree to which the self is perceived as a part of social environment is modulated by cultural stereotypes, such as collectivism and individualism. Here, we tested the hypothesis that individuals who endorse collectivist values would spontaneously think more about their relationships with other people and this association would be mediated by connectivity between the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) and the rest of the brain. Connectivity was evaluated based on resting state EEG data using the recently developed methods, which combine beamformer spatial filtering with seed based connectivity estimation. The formal mediation analysis revealed that collectivism is associated with an enhanced connectivity of MPFC with a set of cortical regions that are frequently co-activated in moral reasoning, empathy, and theory of mind tasks and with diminished connectivity with the precuneus\posterior cingulate cortex, which is involved in self-centered cognition. The relationship between collectivism and social cognition was mediated by MPFC connectivity with the left middle temporal gyrus implying that in participants with collectivistic attitude, thinking about relationships with other people may be associated with semantic memory retrieval and reasoning on moral issues and others' intentions.}

BVCW are part of territorial bioeconomy systems and are shaped by contextual settings. The design and development of BVCW involve strategic decisions towards their sustainable implementation. Throughout the design and development of BVCW, the adoption of an integral approach that links technical aspects of biomass-to-product pathways with non-technical aspects and context factors is necessary to increase the BVCW implementation potential. Accordingly, an active incorporation of the territorial context of BVCW in the design process is required. In view of these requirements, in this study an integrated, multi-criteria framework is developed to assess the implementation potential in BVCW design. For this purpose, key elements from existing biorefinery and biomass supply chain design methodologies are identified and integrated in a multi-criteria framework that allows the consideration of both an internal and external perspective of the BVCW in relation to the context. The conceptualized framework serves as an evaluation approach to check the implementability of biomass-to-product pathways BVCW configurations in form of by means of a multi-criteria catalogue. The set of criteria integrates relevant aspects for the design and development of BVCW from land-based biomass (e.g. crops and crop residues). It entails key criteria related to the functionality of the biomass-to-product pathway in technical-economic terms and the surrounding biophysical, social and economic context. The further operationalization of the multi-criteria catalogue by means of an indicator-based assessment could enable the prioritization and selection of BVCW configurations with best implementation potential. In this way, the framework provides a practical approach for decision-makers, local actors and researchers involved in the design and development of BVCW tailored to the territorial context.}

Current societal challenges exceed the capacity of humans operating either alone or collectively. As AI evolves, its role within human collectives will vary from an assistive tool to a participatory member. Humans and AI possess complementary capabilities that, together, can surpass the collective intelligence of either humans or AI in isolation. However, the interactions in human-AI systems are inherently complex, involving intricate processes and interdependencies. This review incorporates perspectives from complex network science to conceptualize a multilayer representation of human-AI collective intelligence, comprising cognition, physical, and information layers. Within this multilayer network, humans and AI agents exhibit varying characteristics; humans differ in diversity from surface-level to deep-level attributes, while AI agents range in degrees of functionality and anthropomorphism. We explore how agents’ diversity and interactions influence the system’s collective intelligence and analyze real-world instances of AI-enhanced collective intelligence. We conclude by considering potential challenges and future developments in this field.}

abstract = {The dynamic qualities of looking around and moving about, directly sensing spatial queues, using one’s peripheral vision, and focusing with foveal vision on objects of attention are fundamental to a person’s visual experience in landscape. Unfortunately, the visual media commonly used to structure scientific analysis, professional design, decision-making and artistic interpretation of visual landscapes are quite weak at portraying the dynamic and peripheral dimensions of human vision. Also, visual media whether it be manual drawing, photomontage or state-of-the-art computer animation tend to be time consuming and difficult to apply to these dimensions of seeing. The absence of a convenient, cost-effective means for showing all the fundamental visual aspects of landscape in a balanced way is a serious limitation. This deficiency begs the following questions. Is the current state of knowledge in visual landscape management biased by the relative ease with which established media, such as illustration, photography, and photo-realistic rendering can be used? Do the characteristics of these media bias our perception and thinking about landscape toward static foveal aspects of visual experience? Are our ideas about dynamic viewing and computer animation limited by the didactic frame-by-frame approach characteristic of cinematography and video? Can the introduction of equally robust tools and methods for dynamic and peripheral viewing balance any bias caused by current visualization technology? If McLuhan’s insights about media are correct, then we need to do more research on this question. This paper suggests that the field of landscape visualization needs to develop instruments for research that more fully capture the fundamental components of human vision before we can properly study the question or advance practice. It outlines some ways the next generation of visualization technology can be used to balance the disproportionate emphasis on foveal ways of visual thinking commonly used in the past for the study of visual landscapes. The paper explains this deficiency and proposes some area for research and development of visualization instruments more capable of redressing this imbalance. The paper outlines this issue and proposes that as electronic media and computational media become more developed and are applied to the realm of visual concerns, it will become more practical to include peripheral vision and dynamic viewing in deliberations about visual landscapes. This paper reflects on the potential of visualization automation techniques to overcome these shortcomings through illustrations of project work using innovative software tools developed to explore this question at the Centre for Landscape Research (CLR) at the University of Toronto.}

However, the substantial computational and storage requirements inherent to DNNs are usually high, which poses challenges for deploying deep learning models on resource-limited devices and hindering further applications. To address this issue, the lightweight nature of neural networks has garnered significant attention, and quantization has become one of the most popular approaches to compress DNNs. In this paper, we introduce a sparse loss-aware ternarization (SLT) model for training ternary neural networks, which encodes the floating-point parameters into {−1,0,1}. Specifically, we abstract the ternarization process as an optimization problem with discrete constraints, and then modify it by applying sparse regularization to identify insignificant weights. To deal with the challenges brought by the discreteness of the model, we decouple discrete constraints from the objective function and design a new algorithm based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). Extensive experiments are conducted on public datasets with popular network architectures. Comparisons with several state-of-the-art baselines demonstrate that SLT always attains comparable accuracy while having better compression performance.}

The vectors of abstractness ratings and Flynn effect gains, controlled for guessing) exhibit a near-zero correlation (r=−.02); however, abstractness correlates positively with (and is therefore confounded by) g-loadings (r=.61). A General Linear Model is used to determine the degree to which the abstractness vector predicts the Flynn effect vector, independently of subtest g-loadings and the portion of the secular IQ gain due to guessing (the Brand effect). Consistent with the abstract reasoning model of the Flynn effect, abstractness positively predicts Flynn effect magnitudes, once controlled for confounds (sr=.44), which indicates an increasing tendency to utilize factors external to the items in order to abstract their solutions.}

Whilst dopamine controls attention, serotonin is the key for inhibition, and fear is a elicitator for inhibitory and protective processes. This inhibition can promote [in a cognitive system] to blocking behaviour which can be labelled as ’depression’. Therefore, our interest is how to reimplement biomimetically both action-regulators without the computational system to resulting in a ‘failed’ scenario. We have simulated 1000ms of the dopamine system using NEST Neural Simulation Tool with the rat brain as the model. The results of the simulation experiments are reported with an evaluation to demonstrate the correctness of our hypothesis.}

However, early optimization strategies were overly simplistic and lacked automated updating and iterative capabilities. With the evolution of artificial intelligence (AI), researchers have applied deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms to system operations. However, the optimization focus has been limited to the internal systems, lacking global optimization. In this paper, a global optimization control strategy based on the Dueling double-deep Q network (D3QN) and value decomposition network (VDN) algorithms is proposed to make the DCs system operate more closely with the upstream, midstream, and downstream. By adjusting battery charging/discharging capacity, computational workload, and waste heat utilization heating temperature global synergistic optimization is achieved. Compared with without optimization, renewable energy waste, operation cost, total electricity consumption, and grid electricity consumption are reduced by 18.37%, 9.78%, 4.01%, and 29.74%, respectively. Additionally, a detailed comparison between non-algorithmic optimization and algorithmic optimization is provided, offering valuable insights for substantial energy savings and emissions reduction in DCs. The results demonstrate the importance of fully exploring the interactive potential between upstream energy supply, midstream computational workload, and downstream waste heat recovery to achieve synergistic global optimization of “computing power", “thermal energy" and “electrical energy" for the sustainable and green development of DCs or other prosumer buildings.}

Originating in a foundational dispute as to the correct way to characterise sets, logicians and computer scientists came to see maximizing and minimizing extremal axiomatisations as a dual pair, each necessary to represent entities of interest. In particular, many important infinitely large entities can be characterised in terms of such axiomatisations. We consider reasons for the delay in arriving at the coalgebraic framework, despite many unrecognised manifestations occurring years earlier, and discuss an apparent asymmetry in the relationship between algebra and coalgebra.}

Spontaneous thought shares many commonalities with memory processes. We use insights from computational models of memory to explain how the stream of thought flows through the landscape of memory. In this framework of spontaneous thought, semantic memory scaffolds episodic memory to form the content of thought, and drifting context modulated by one's current state – both internal and external – constrains the area of memory to explore. This conceptualization of spontaneous thought can help to answer outstanding questions such as: what is the function of spontaneous thought, and how does the mind select what to think about?}

abstract = {The methodological principle of synechism, the all-pervading continuity first proposed by Charles Peirce in 1892, is reinvigorated in the present paper to prompt a comprehensive reevaluation of the integrated concepts of life, machines, agency, and intelligence. The evidence comes from the intersections of synthetic bioengineering, developmental biology, and cognitive and computational sciences. As a regulative principle, synechism, “that continuity governs the whole domain of experience in every element of it”, has been shown to infiltrate fundamental issues of contemporary biology, including cognition in different substrates, embodied agency, collectives (swarm and nested), intelligence on multiple scales, and developmental bioelectricity in morphogenesis. In the present paper, we make explicit modern biology's turn to this fundamental feature of science in its rejection of conceptual binaries, preference for collectives over individuals, quantitative over qualitative, and multiscale applicability of the emerging hypotheses about the integration of the first principles of the diversity of life. Specifically, synechism presents itself as the bedrock for research encompassing biological machines, chimaeras, organoids, and Xenobots. We then review a synechistic framework that embeds functionalist, information-theoretic, pragmaticist and inferentialist approaches to springboard to continuum-driven biosystemic behaviour.}

This study proposes a novel multi-modal information fusion-based, multi-task end-to-end model that integrates RGB images, depth maps, and semantic segmentation data, enhancing situational awareness and predictive precision. Utilizing a Vision Transformer (ViT) for comprehensive spatial feature extraction and a Residual-CNN-BiGRU structure for capturing temporal dependencies, the model fuses spatiotemporal features to predict vehicle speed and steering angle with high precision. Through comparative, ablation, and generalization tests on the Udacity and self-collected datasets, the proposed model achieves steering angle prediction errors of MSE 0.012 rad, RMSE 0.109 rad, and MAE 0.074 rad, and speed prediction errors of MSE 0.321 km/h, RMSE 0.567 km/h, and MAE 0.373 km/h, outperforming existing driving behavior prediction models. Key contributions of this study include the development of a channel difference attention mechanism and advanced spatiotemporal feature fusion techniques, which improve predictive accuracy and robustness. These methods effectively balance computational efficiency and predictive performance, contributing to practical advancements in driving behavior prediction.}

In view of the current and future challenges in industrial production, it is becoming apparent that ecological requirements are becoming increasingly important in automation solutions. For example, in form of resource efficiency, transformability and material efficiency. In this context, especially materials handling technology is subject of various optimization approaches, as no value is added to the part handled. The question: "How does material flow occur in nature?" thus offers biologically inspired approaches to thinking about transport in the industrial sector. This paper first presents a selection of concepts or existing mechanisms that are adaptable in materials- handling technology and have been developed based on a biological model. In the second part of this paper, a new concept is presented that is modeled on peristalsis as a transport mechanism. The approach presented here uses tensegrity-structures for assembly, which are characterized by their high material efficiency and flexibility. The transport movement is achieved by peristaltic typical contraction or relaxation of the respective structure parts.}

abstract = {This study considers the Single Candidate Optimizer (SCO) as an alternative to population-based heuristics, that is faster than them. Although the SCO algorithm is a fast single-candidate-based heuristic, it has certain limitations. To overcome these limitations and enhance the search performance of SCO, several solutions were proposed in this study. First, owing to the single-candidate nature of the SCO, the initial solution position can play a critical role. To compensate for this, an accelerated opposition-learning mechanism was integrated into the SCO. In addition, instead of the equation that is active when the number of unsuccessful improvement attempts is reached in the SCO structure, a mutation operator including chaotic functions (Levy, Gauss, and Cauchy) has been incorporated into the algorithm. Again, equations based on new approaches were added to the SCO algorithm to update the position of the candidate solution during the exploration and exploitation phases. Finally, the standard boundary value control mechanism is replaced with a more effective one. The algorithm developed in this study is named Accelerated Opposition Learning based Chaotic Single Candidate Optimizer (AccOppCSCO), inspired by the accelerated opposition learning mechanism and the mutation operator involving chaotic behaviors. The search capability of the proposed AccOppCSCO algorithm was first analyzed using four different methods: convergence, search history, trajectory, and computational complexity. The effectiveness of the mechanisms used in the AccOppCSCO algorithm for four different two-dimensional benchmark problems from the IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation 2014 (CEC2014) package was demonstrated. Subsequently, the performance of the proposed AccOppCSCO algorithm was evaluated on the CEC2014 and IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation 2020 (CEC2020) benchmark problems with different dimensions. The results show that the AccOppCSCO algorithm works effectively in the CEC2014 and CEC2020 test sets and offers better optimization results than SCO. The AccOppCSCO algorithm ranked first in the overall evaluation of the 30-dimensional CEC2014 comparison results with State of the Art (SOTA) heuristics from the literature. Finally, for ten different engineering design problems, the AccOppCSCO algorithm was analyzed and compared with the original SCO and other SOTA heuristics. The results show that AccOppCSCO is effective for engineering design problems. This emphasizes that the algorithm can work effectively on a wide range of problems and can be used in various applications. The source code of the AccOppCSCO algorithm for the CEC2014 benchmark suite is publicly available at https://github.com/uguryuzgec/AccOppCSCO.}

The primary visual cortex is one of the most well understood regions supporting the processing involved in sensory computation. Following the popularization of high-density neural recordings, it has been observed that the activity of large neural populations is often constrained to low dimensional manifolds. In this work, we quantify the structure of such neural manifolds in the visual cortex. We do this by analyzing publicly available two-photon optical recordings of mouse primary visual cortex in response to visual stimuli with a densely sampled rotation angle. Using a geodesic metric along with persistent homology, we discover that population activity in response to such stimuli generates a circular manifold, encoding the angle of rotation. Furthermore, we observe that this circular manifold is expressed differently in subpopulations of neurons with differing orientation and direction selectivity. Finally, we discuss some of the obstacles to reliably retrieving the truthful topology generated by a neural population.}

However, the last couple of decades have seen a rapid growth of research interest in the pairing of flavours. Nowadays, one can find examples of people pairing everything from beer with food, tea with cheese and chocolate, etc. As interest in the marketing potential of flavour pairing has risen, along with the growing public fascination in the topic, scientists have become increasingly interested in trying to understand the principles (both cognitive/intellectual and perceptual) underlying the successful pairing of flavours. In this narrative review, the relative strengths and weaknesses of the chemical, computational (gastronomy), and perceptual approaches to pairing flavours are highlighted. Thereafter, I show how the various principles of pairing (both perceptual and cognitive/intellectual) can be extended beyond the domain of pairing flavour with flavour to consider the rapidly growing are of sonic seasoning. The latter term refers to those situations in which specific pieces of music or soundscapes are matched, or paired, with particular tastes/flavours based on the crossmodal correspondences. The review ends by considering the future development of pairings flavours, and assessing novel means of establishing connections between flavours and other sensations.}

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study with these characteristics. Methods: Inspired by the Gricean account of natural language use, we tailored a novel treatment addressing the pragmatics of communication (PragmaCom) and we tested its efficacy in a sample of individuals with schizophrenia randomized to the experimental group or to an active control group. The primary outcome with respect to the efficacy of the PragmaCom was measured by changes in pragmatic abilities (as evaluated with the global score of the Assessment of Pragmatic Abilities and Cognitive Substrates test) from baseline to 12 weeks and at 3-month follow-up. The secondary outcome was measured by changes in metaphor comprehension, abstract thinking, and global functioning from baseline to 12 weeks and at 3-month follow-up. Results: Relative to the control group, at post-test the PragmaCom group showed greater and enduring improvement in global pragmatic skills and in metaphor comprehension. At follow-up, these improvements persisted and the PragmaCom exerted beneficial effects also on functioning. Conclusions: Despite the limited sample size, we believe that these findings offer initial yet encouraging evidence of the possibility to improve pragmatic skills with a theoretically grounded approach and to obtain durable and clinically relevant benefits. We argue that it is time that therapeutic efforts embrace communicative dysfunctions in order to improve illness outcome.}

There is a growing realization that graduate education in the biomedical sciences is successful at teaching students how to conduct research but falls short in preparing them for a diverse job market, communicating with the public, and remaining versatile scientists throughout their careers. Major problems with graduate level education today include overspecialization in a narrow area of science without a proper grounding in essential critical thinking skills. Shortcomings in education may also contribute to some of the problems of the biomedical sciences, such as poor reproducibility, shoddy literature, and the rise in retracted publications. The challenge is to modify graduate programs such that they continue to generate individuals capable of conducting deep research while at the same time producing more broadly trained scientists without lengthening the time to a degree. Here we describe our first experiences at Johns Hopkins and propose a manifesto for reforming graduate science education.}

I argue that to understand surplus food and its potential futures (consumed or wasted), closer engagement with anticipatory thinking is needed. Drawing on interview data with key stakeholders and observations of the food industry redistribution process the paper explores the anticipatory actions taken by different actors as they attempt to manage the possible futures of foods that become categorized as surplus. The paper shows how different market devices are used to manage market concerns about surplus food and work to assure its future consumption. The devices focus on managing the risks of the food becoming unsafe and the associated legal liabilities. The market concerns, as expressions of anticipatory thinking, inform a series of anticipatory practices throughout the redistribution process to enable all actors, and especially the Retailer, to trust in the process. The paper concludes by noting how reliant the redistribution process is on anticipatory practices, especially pre-emption and improvisation to make the process workable, but also how these work to contain the various concerns within market arrangements. The paper highlights the importance of anticipation as a theoretical basis for exploring surplus food and the concept of surplus more widely.}

In order to provide effective assistance, SARs need to be personalized to individual patients and account for stimulating their divergent thinking in creative ways. Rule-based fuzzy logic systems provide effective methods for automated decision-making of SARs. However, expanding and modifying the rules of fuzzy logic systems to account for the evolving needs, preferences, and medical conditions of patients can be tedious and costly. In this paper, we introduce EFS4SAR, a novel Evolving Fuzzy logic System for Socially Assistive Robots that supports autonomous evolution of the fuzzy rules that steer the behavior of the SAR. EFS4SAR combines traditional rule-based fuzzy logic systems with evolutionary algorithms, which model the process of evolution in nature and have shown to result in creative behaviors. We evaluate EFS4SAR via computer simulations on both synthetic and real-world data. The results show that the fuzzy rules evolved over time are not only personalized with respect to the personal preferences and therapeutic needs of the patients, but they also meet the following criteria for creativity of SARs: originality and effectiveness of the therapeutic tasks proposed to the patients. Compared to existing evolving fuzzy systems, EFS4SAR achieves similar effectiveness with higher degree of originality.}

In particular, optimizing visual and thermal comfort simultaneously is a difficult topic due to mutual conflicts between them. This literature review article studies the façade, as a complex interface between inside of buildings and the outside that has a capability to function as a protective or regulatory element against severe fluctuations of external climate. Six interrelated subjects are studied including kinetic façade, biomimicry, building form as a microclimate modifier, energy efficiency, comfort condition, parametric design thinking. The literature review process answers following research questions: (1) what are the interdisciplinary subjects corresponding to kinetic façade design process for creating an innovative architectural process? (2) What is the most important factor in kinetic façade design with the aim to improve occupants’ visual and thermal comfort simultaneously based on multidisciplinary investigation? Many research has been carried out about kinetic façade concepts strategies, principles, and criteria. However, interdisciplinary studies for proposing kinetic façade form is relatively rare. Also, adaptive daylight façade with daily solar geometry variation has been highly required. Therefore, generative-parametric and quick form finding method for responding to different climates would be a solution for providing more adaptability to dynamic daylight. This study aims to propose a kinetic façade design process which have capability to improve occupant visual & thermal comfort simultaneously by controlling on-site renewable energy resources consist of solar radiation and wind. Façade as an only interface between inside and outside of building, far from the literal and historical perceptions, is recognized by intrinsic functional attributes including complexity, heterogeneity and multidisciplinary. Moreover, the interrelated subjects impact façade form individually and aggregately regard to functional scenario that is changed the perception of kinetic façade from elegant and fashionable state to a functional and practical element.}

By using a variation of the colored successive over-relaxation iteration, our finite difference model takes full advantage of the performance of massively parallel computers. Evaluations of the accuracy and performance of the model show the practicality of using specific anatomical models to recover the electrocardiographic field distributions for individual subjects. A relatively modest parallel machine is capable of assembling and computing a specific direct inverse solution from body surface potentials within an hour of measurement, assuming the magnetic resonance imaging classification has been previously completed.}

abstract = {In a complex financial system, what is the forecasting performance of macro and micro evolution models of Econophysics on asset prices? For this problem, from the perspective of machine learning, we study the dynamic forecasting and liquidity assessment of financial markets, based on econophysics and Bayesian methods. We establish eight dynamic prediction methods, based on our proposed likelihood estimation and Bayesian estimation methods of macro and micro evolution models of econophysics. Combined machine learning thinking and real data, we empirically study and simulate the out-of-sample dynamic forecasting analysis of eight proposed methods and compare with the benchmark GARCH model. A variety of loss functions, superior predictive ability test (SPA), Akaike and Bayesian information criterion (AIC and BIC) methods are introduced to further evaluate the forecasting performance of our proposed methods. The research of out of sample prediction shows that (1) the method of the simplified stochastic model with Bayesian method for only sample return has the best forecasting performance; (2) the method of the stochastic model with Bayesian method for only return samples has the worst forecasting performance. For the liquidity assessment problem, there is a strong correlation between the trading probability evaluated by the proposed eight methods and the real turnover rate, and an increase of liquidity is correspond to the increase of asset risk. In other words, it suggests that all proposed methods can well evaluate market liquidity.}

Over recent decades, much effort, both in research and in practice, has been devoted to building construction and urban planning for the improvement of energy efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions. However, the accuracy of modelling and evaluation of energy and carbon performance for buildings and urban precincts remains limited, affected by inadequate energy intensity data and highly integrated building systems, as well as the complex interactions between buildings and the urban eco-system. This paper presents a critical review of current measures and models for representing and assessing life cycle energy as well as associated emissions profiles at both the building and the precinct levels. It also identifies influential factors and explores interactions among buildings, surrounding environment and user behaviours at the urban precinct level by taking a systems perspective. Based on such a review, this study maps out some key challenges for integrating energy and carbon metrics, and finally proposes a precinct-level system boundary definition and an integrated model following systems thinking. The proposed model can facilitate a critical thinking approach about the evaluations of global energy and emissions, and support the quantification of energy consumption and associated emissions for building precinct systems.}

There are irregularities in investment cases generated by the Mental Health Compartment Model. We discuss these irregularities and highlight the costing techniques that may be introduced to improve mental health investment cases.
Methods
This analysis uses data from the World Bank, the World Health Organization Mental Health Compartment Model, the United Nations Development Program, the Kenya Ministry of Health, and Statistics from the Kenyan National Commission of Human Rights.
Results
We demonstrate that the Mental Health Compartment Model produces irrelevant outcomes that are not helpful for clinical settings. The model inflated the productivity gains generated from mental health investment. In some cases, the model underestimated the economic costs of mental health. Such limitation renders the investment cases poor in providing valuable intervention points from the perspectives of both the users and the providers.
Conclusions
There is a need for further calibration and validation of the investment case outcomes. The current estimated results cannot be used to guide service provision, research, and mental health programming comprehensively.}

This standard consists of parameter estimation, prediction error assessment, and a parameter sensitivity analysis that is driven by outside individuals who are skeptical of the model’s credibility (hereafter, skeptics). Ecological/environmental models that have a one-step-ahead prediction error rate that is better than naive forecasting — and are not excessively sensitive to small changes in their parameter values are said here to be vetted. A procedure is described that can perform this assessment on any model being evaluated for possible participation in an ecosystem management decision. Uncertainty surrounding the model’s ability to predict future values of its output variables and in the estimates of all of its parameters should be part of any effort to vett a model. The vetting procedure described herein, Prediction Error Rate-Deterministic Sensitivity Analysis (PER-DSA), incorporates these two aspects of model uncertainty. DSA in particular, requires participation by skeptics and is the reason why a successful DSA gives a model sufficient credibility to have a voice in ecosystem management decision making. But these models need to be stochastic and represent the mechanistic processes of the system being modeled. For such models, performing a PER-DSA can be computationally expensive. A cluster computing algorithm to speed-up these computations is described as one way to answer this challenge. This new standard is illustrated through a PER-DSA of a population dynamics model of South African rhinoceros (Ceratotherium simum simum).}

These effects are reflected in their physiological responses such as heart rate, electrodermal activity, and skin temperature. Occupants' individual preferences, sensitivity, and physiological responses to different combinations of room temperature and illuminance level can differ among individuals. Despite previous studies investigating the individual and combined effects of different IEQ parameters, the limited research on the cross-modal relationship between room temperature and illuminance level and its impact on mental task performance highlights its significance. Moreover, to achieve personalized insights, it is essential to incorporate individual physiological responses, and this necessitates the development of an optimization model to comprehensively examine their impact. To address these issues, this study proposes a personalized model that optimizes room temperature and illuminance levels to enhance mental task performance using occupants' physiological data. Having the random forest algorithm, this study first predicted mental task performance, which includes four mental abilities such as attention, perception, working memory, and thinking ability using the occupant's physiological data. Then, the particle swarm optimization algorithm was employed to optimize room temperature and illuminance level to maximize the predicted mental task performance. The results of the proposed model align with observed values of room temperature and illuminance level during experiments, validating the adoption of a personalized approach. The findings contribute to future insights and guidelines for the design and management of indoor environments to maximize occupants' performance.}

Ninety-five Chinese EFL learners were randomly assigned to an argumentative writing task under three conditions: metacognitive thinking aloud (MTA), nonmetacognitive thinking aloud (NMTA), and no thinking aloud (NTA), after they completed a similar baseline writing task. Their essays were analyzed in terms of linguistic fluency, complexity, accuracy, and overall quality to examine if there were any significant between-group differences that could be taken as evidence of reactivity. After controlling for baseline differences, analyses revealed no traces of reactivity left on a majority of measures except that: (a) the two think-aloud conditions significantly increased dysfluencies in participants’ essays; (b) they also tended to reduce syntactic variety of the essays; and (c) MTA significantly prolonged time on task and retarded the speed of written production. These negative effects are interpreted in light of Kellogg's (1996) cognitive model of writing as suggesting no serious interference with L2 writing processes and are taken as cautions for, rather than counterevidence against, the use of the think-aloud method to obtain L2 writing process data.}

abstract = {Most of our movement consists of sequences of discrete actions at regular intervals—including speech, walking, playing music, or even chewing. Despite this, few models of the motor system address how the brain determines the interval at which to trigger actions. This paper offers a theoretical analysis of the problem of timing movements. We consider a scenario in which we must align an alternating movement with a regular external (auditory) stimulus. We assume that our brains employ generative world models that include internal clocks of various speeds. These allow us to associate a temporally regular sensory input with an internal clock, and actions with parts of that clock cycle. We treat this as process of inferring which clock best explains sensory input. This offers a way in which temporally discrete choices might emerge from a continuous process. This is not straightforward, particularly if each of those choices unfolds during a time that has a (possibly unknown) duration. We develop a route for translation to neurology, in the context of Parkinson’s disease—a disorder that characteristically slows down movements. The effects are often elicited in clinic by alternating movements. We find that it is possible to reproduce behavioural and electrophysiological features associated with parkinsonism by disrupting specific parameters—that determine the priors for inferences made by the brain. We observe three core features of Parkinson’s disease: amplitude decrement, festination, and breakdown of repetitive movements. Our simulations provide a mechanistic interpretation of how pathology and therapeutics might influence behaviour and neural activity.}

We take it that a central approach to explanation in systems neuroscience is that of mechanistic modeling, where understanding the system requires us to characterize its parts, organization, and activities, and how those give rise to behaviors of interest. However, it remains controversial what it takes for a model to be mechanistic, and whether computational models such as neural networks qualify as explanatory on this approach. We argue that certain kinds of neural network models are actually good examples of mechanistic models, when an appropriate notion of mechanistic mapping is deployed. Building on existing work on model-to-mechanism mapping (3M), we describe criteria delineating such a notion, which we call 3M++. These criteria require us, first, to identify an abstract level of description that is still detailed enough to be “runnable”, and then, to construct model-to-brain mappings using the same principles as those employed for brain-to-brain mapping across individuals. Perhaps surprisingly, the abstractions required are just those already in use in experimental neuroscience and deployed in the construction of more familiar computational models — just as the principles of inter-brain mappings are very much in the spirit of those already employed in the collection and analysis of data across animals. In a companion paper, we address the relationship between optimization and intelligibility, in the context of functional evolutionary explanations. Taken together, mechanistic interpretations of computational models and the dependencies between form and function illuminated by optimization processes can help us to understand why brain systems are built they way they are.}

To address these challenges, we developed a generic optimization-based land allocation approach, which provides i) a composite FEW-N metric to help solve the multi-objective optimization problem and carry out assessments, and ii) a two-stage decomposition strategy to solve the multi-scale and multi-period planning and scheduling problem. The developed strategy was applied in a case study within the Texas Edwards Region.

It can also serve as a missing link between science and art in STEAM curricula thanks to its finding itself halfway between the two. A handful of analogies are drawn here from chess, illustrated sporadically with positions from real-life chess games and converted to lessons in creativity for students in natural sciences. The discussion centered around these analogies is reinforced by a literature review of studies conducted over the past 80 years to assess the effect of exposing students to lessons in chess on their learning in distant domains. Overall, great benefits can emerge from complementing science education with chess and it is hoped that chess will become an integral part of basic education in primary schools and universities worldwide in the near future.}

But, it tends to suffer from premature stagnation, trapped in the local minimum and loses exploration capability as the iteration progresses. On the contrary, Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA) is proficient for searching global optimum, however, its drawback is its slow searching speed in the final phase. To overcome these problems in this paper a novel Hybrid Gravitational Search Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm (HGSPSO) is presented. The key concept behind the proposed method is to merge the local search ability of GSA with the capability for social thinking (gbest) of PSO. To examine the effectiveness of these methods in solving the abovementioned issues of slow convergence rate and trapping in local minima five standard and some modern CEC benchmark functions are used to ensure the efficacy of the presented method. Additionally, a DNA sequence problem is also solved to confirm the proficiency of the proposed method. Different parameters such as Hairpin, Continuity, H-measure, and Similarity are employed as objective functions. A hierarchal approach was used to solve this multi-objective problem where a single objective function is first obtained through a weighted sum method and the results were then empirically validated. The proposed algorithm has demonstrated an extraordinary performance per solution stability and convergence.}

It encompasses various concepts and methods, deployed by researchers in many diverse fields of computation and cognition.

The usefulness of AI ethically, initiates a big question i.e. if the human mind is not self-sufficient for any work without harming the moral sentiment of others then, how can people believe in a computational model of the mind, is a machine, morally responsible for any good or bad action. We highlight issues on the use of AI in the replacement of the human mind asking what is the value of humans in this age of AI? Can AI reciprocate and respect human values better than human beings? Can AI replace human intelligence? In the case of ethical enquiry, it is rather a herculean task to consider a machine's action to be moral or immoral, after all, it is just a machinery action devoid of any moral quality.}

abstract = {The topic of this paper evolves on the discourse of digital modeling in landscape design. Current design methods stagger to address physical forms and dynamics present in the environment. This status quo limits possibilities to integrate scientific evidence when developing spatial and aesthetic configurations in urban landscapes. Remote sensing technology such as laser scanning measures physical forms to reproduce them as geo-specific digital 3D models, while dynamic simulation is widely used to predict how scenarios will perform under given conditions. However, there is still a need for a holistic design process that is capable of integrating both the measured physical forms and physical dynamics. This paper presents a novel framework using point cloud modeling to shape design scenarios that are iteratively evaluated for their performance. The proposed framework is demonstrated through a case study in Singapore. New spatial configurations are tested for the site through an iterative and comparative analysis of the design performance. The case study exposes (1) a site-specific design approach by iteratively modeling a laser-scanned point cloud model, (2) a workflow to convert the geometric data from the point cloud models into voxels and meshes, (3) an integration of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation during design development as per-point attributes, and (4) a comparison of the configurations to identify best performing scenarios. This design framework can support city managers, planners, urban and landscape designers to better inform their decision-making process by relying on accurate scientific feedback. By guiding the design process with the consideration of the built environment as a complex adaptive system, it will be possible to improve how open spaces and ecosystem services perform in cities, and to design landscapes that can mitigate dynamic events such as urban heat islands.}

abstract = {A novel ERP paradigm was employed to investigate conceptual expansion, a central component of creative thinking. Participants were presented with word pairs, consisting of everyday objects and uses for these objects, which had to be judged based on the two defining criteria of creative products: unusualness and appropriateness. Three subject-determined trial types resulted from this judgement: high unusual and low appropriate (nonsensical uses), low unusual and high appropriate (common uses), and high unusual and high appropriate (creative uses). Word pairs of the creative uses type are held to passively induce conceptual expansion. The N400 component was not specifically modulated by conceptual expansion but was, instead, generally responsive as a function of unusualness or novelty of the stimuli (nonsense=creative>common). Explorative analyses in a later time window (500–900ms) revealed that ERP activity in this phase indexes appropriateness (nonsense>creative=common). In the discussion of these findings with reference to the literature on semantic cognition, both components are proposed as indexing processes relevant to conceptual expansion as they are selectively involved in the encoding and integration of a newly established semantic connection between two previously unrelated concepts.}

abstract = {The economic pressures and increasing competition in markets have led to the CEOs of companies being forced to make the right strategic decisions in the development of products for selling the right products to the right customers. To achieve this goal, companies need to know which criteria of their products lead to customer loyalty to that product. In the past, various methods have been introduced to obtain the importance (weight) of criteria that use the opinions of experts or customers. There is a halo effect in human decisions that leads to biases in evaluating the criteria by influencing human emotions. This study introduces a new method for weight assessment of the product loyalty criteria by considering the customer's decisions halo effect using the convolutional neural network (CNN) called the halo effect using the convolutional neural networks (HECON) method. In the HECON method to consider the halo effect of the customer decisions, a CNN model is proposed as the deep learning pipeline to obtain more accurate weights of the criteria. The HECON method to obtain the weight of the criteria and identify criteria that lead to product loyalty needs to collect the feedback of a large number of customers based on the net promoter score (NPS) scale. The innovation of the HECON method is to obtain the effect level of each product criterion on selection and loyalty to the product through the feedback of a large number of customers by considering the halo effect on the customers' thinking. To date, the analyzing methods have often not been able to identify the halo effect in evaluating the reasons for customer loyalty to the product. The halo effect indicates sometimes some of the product criteria secretly affect the customers' opinions that require deep neural networks to analyze them. By using the deep CNN model of the HECON method to evaluate product criteria for understanding customer behavior, companies will be able to identify customers' behavior and develop their products exactly following the customer's desires. To evaluate the performance and demonstrate the applicability of the HECON method, presented two case studies. It is presented that there are challenging differences between the results of the HECON method with the other methods because the HECON method considers the halo effect on the customer decisions and demonstrates better performance.}

We hypothesize that multicultural experiences are related to both types of development, describe the cognitive processes through which multicultural experiences theoretically facilitate development, and present empirical data supporting the association. Though the underlying developmental constructs were initially conceptualized as stage theories, we borrow from cognitive science and contemporary theories of human learning (Derry, 1996) to think of moral and intercultural development in terms of increasing sociocognitive flexibility. Intercultural and moral development share the common element of a critical shift from rigid to flexible thinking. In moral reasoning, this is characterized by the shift from conventional to post-conventional thinking. In intercultural development, a similar movement occurs between the ethnocentric and ethnorelative orientations of intercultural sensitivity. In order to test our hypothesis, college students (n=70) took measures of intercultural development (Intercultural Development Inventory), moral judgment (Defining Issues Test), and multicultural experience (Multicultural Experience Questionnaire). The results indicate that moral judgment and intercultural development are significantly related to one another. Both are related to multicultural experiences, particularly depth of the experiences, as opposed to breadth.}

To do this, we implemented a computational model for analysing the barriers to innovation in the Colombian case. In this model, product and processes innovation are studied. It was concluded that for the innovation of process, the highly important barrier is the shortcoming of internal financing, while for the innovation of product is the lack of employees. Results show that the government expenditure is scarce compared to private and external investment.}

However, it is not yet known whether human social strategies, which are well adapted to the offline world we developed in, operate as effectively within this new social environment. Here, we describe how the computational framework of reinforcement learning (RL) can help us to precisely frame this problem and diagnose where behavior-environment mismatches emerge. The RL framework describes a process by which an agent can learn to maximize their long-term reward. RL, which has proven to be successful in characterizing human social behavior, consists of 3 stages: updating expected reward, valuating expected reward by integrating subjective costs such as effort, and selecting an action. Specific social media affordances, such as the quantifiability of social feedback, may interact with the RL process at each of these stages. In some cases, affordances can exploit RL biases that are beneficial offline by violating the environmental conditions under which such biases are optimal, such as when algorithmic personalization of content interacts with confirmation bias. Characterizing the impact of specific aspects of social media through this lens can improve our understanding of how digital environments shape human behavior. Ultimately, this formal framework could help address pressing open questions about social media use, including its changing role across human development and its impact on outcomes such as mental health.}

abstract = {Existing models of intelligent design system nowadays are generally logic-based, which solve only simple and small-scale design problems. In the author's opinion, these models which concentrate only on far-fetched use of logical inference and abstract knowledge deviate from designer's thinking and decision process; the crux of the deviation is the lack of imitating thinking with mental imagery ability. Considering the nature of design problems and imitating rational thinking with alternate use of pattern association and symbolic operation, a new intelligent design system (IDS) model and its implementation techniques are presented. Imitation of thinking with mental imagery which is also called pattern association in the IDS model is considered by applying artificial neural network (ANN) techniques. The pattern association in the IDS model imitates the rule of human thinking, “comprehending by analogy”, to some extent. Because of the robustness of the pattern-type knowledge used in pattern association, IDS provides a practical way in producing a design scheme using incomplete and/or undeterminate input data, which is very difficult to achieve in general expert design systems. According to the IDS model, an intelligent structural layout design system of wing (ISDW) is developed. ISDW realizes mapping from key parameters of design requirements and the environment of the wing to the layout design of wing structure in not only graphic form, but also in readable data form. After getting a layout of wing structure, the user will modify it interactively by Auto-CAD, and then return to the ISDW environment to produce FEM meshes by an intelligent meshing interface in order to do the preliminary static and dynamic structural analysis. The design schemes created by the system proved to be proper and usable, and this concludes that IDS model is practicable and practical.}

Considerable fundamental understanding of aryne reactivity has resulted from this body of research. The multi-yne cycloisomerization substrate is typically pre-formed and the (rate-limiting) closure of this diyne/diynophile pair to produce the isomeric benzyne generally requires thermal input, often requiring reaction temperatures of >100 °C and times of 16–48 h to achieve near-full conversion. We report here that diynoic acids can be dimerized and that the resulting substrate, having a 3-atom anhydride linker (i.e., OCOCO), then undergoes HDDA cyclization within minutes at or below room temperature. This allows for the novel in situ assembly and cyclization of HDDA benzyne precursors in an operationally simple protocol. Experimental kinetic data along with DFT computations are used to identify the source of this surprisingly huge rate acceleration afforded by the anhydride linker: >107 faster than the analogous multi-yne having, instead, a CH2OCH2 ether linker.}

abstract = {The optimal power flow methods for AC-DC systems containing VSC-HVDC generally only consider the economy during normal operation, overlooking the distribution of line transmission power in fault conditions. As a result, lines that continue to operate after a fault may experience overloading or operate at full capacity. Thus, a method for optimal power flow calculation is proposed that incorporates N-k security constraints in the preventive-corrective control stage for secure and economic operation of hybrid AC-DC systems. This method ensures that the line transmission power in the system meets the limits in the normal, short-term fault, and long-term fault states. In addition to the optimal power flow in the normal state, the method incorporates the system's imbalance as an indicator to evaluate system resilience. It combines this indicator with the economic, network loss, and performance metrics of the system, forming a two-stage bi-level multi-objective optimization model. Furthermore, to address the curse of dimensionality in anticipating system fault sets, a method for generating the anticipated fault set using non-sequential Monte Carlo simulation is proposed, along with a fault scenario search approach based on robust thinking to identify the most severe faults. Finally, the traditional IEEE 30-bus system was improved, and simulation verification was conducted using examples of an AC/DC system with a three-terminal DC network and a wind-solar-storage hybrid AC/DC system with a three-terminal DC network. The simulation results indicate that the proposed optimal power flow method considering the preventive-corrective control stage with N-k security constraints can effectively enhance system resilience. Furthermore, it improves the economic efficiency while ensuring the secure operation of the system.}

The company’s supply chain consists of suppliers bringing raw materials to a Free Trade Zone (FTZ). The FTZ receives raw materials in full containers from various suppliers, and then the company ships them to various plants (e.g. oil excavation sites) frequently via subcontractors. This allows the company to focus on managing only the inbound transportation and inventory at the FTZ. The demand for each raw material is stochastic. We derive an algorithm running at polynomial time for the stochastic programming formulation and perform μ− regret Robust Optimization to handle the demand uncertainty. We also use a Sample Average Approximation method to alleviate the high computational requirement of the robust optimization model. The modeling approach demonstrated by this paper not only meets the needs of this specific company and industry but also can be applied to other industries with similar supply chain structures.}

abstract = {In a context of mistrust in public health institutions and practices, anti-COVID/vaccination protests and the storming of Congress have illustrated that conspiracy theories are real and immanent threat to health and wellbeing, democracy, and public understanding of science. One manifestation of this is the suggested correlation of COVID-19 with 5G mobile technology. Throughout 2020, this alleged correlation was promoted and distributed widely on social media, often in the form of maps overlaying the distribution of COVID-19 cases with the instillation of 5G towers. These conspiracy theories are not fringe phenomena, and they form part of a growing repertoire for conspiracist activist groups with capacities for organised violence. In this paper, we outline how spatial data have been co-opted, and spatial correlations asserted by conspiracy theorists. We consider the basis of their claims of causal association with reference to three key areas of geographical explanation: (1) how social properties are constituted and how they exert complex causal forces, (2) the pitfalls of correlation with spatial and ecological data, and (3) the challenges of specifying and interpreting causal effects with spatial data. For each, we consider the unique theoretical and technical challenges involved in specifying meaningful correlation, and how their discarding facilitates conspiracist attribution. In doing so, we offer a basis both to interrogate conspiracists’ uses and interpretation of data from elementary principles and offer some cautionary notes on the potential for their future misuse in an age of data democratization. Finally, this paper contributes to work on the basis of conspiracy theories in general, by asserting how – absent an appreciation of these key methodological principles – spatial health data may be especially prone to co-option by conspiracist groups.}

The next two sections review two papers that appear in this volume: one on learning the meanings of words and one on learning the sounds of words. The following section highlights an idea which emerges independently in these two papers and which I have dubbed autonomous bootstrapping. Classical bootstrapping hypotheses propose that children begin to get a toe-hold in a particular linguistic domain, such as syntax, by exploiting information from another domain, such as semantics. Autonomous bootstrapping complements the cross-domain acquisition strategies of classical bootstrapping with strategies that apply within a single domain. Autonomous bootstrapping strategies work by representing partial and/or uncertain linguistic knowledge and using it to analyze the input. The next two sections review two more more contributions to this special issue: one on learning word meanings via selectional preferences and one on algorithms for setting grammatical parameters. The final section suggests directions for future research.}

abstract = {The recognition of Chinese characters has always been a challenging task due to their huge variety and complex structures. The current radical-based methods fail to recognize Chinese characters without learning all of their radicals in the training stage. To this end, we propose a novel Hippocampus-heuristic Character Recognition Network (HCRN), which can recognize unseen Chinese characters only by training part of radicals. More specifically, the network architecture of HCRN is a new pseudo-siamese network designed by us, which can learn features from pairs of input samples and use them to predict unseen characters. The experimental results on the recognition of printed and handwritten characters show that HCRN is robust and effective on zero/few-shot learning tasks. For the printed characters, the mean accuracy of HCRN outperforms the state-of-the-art approach by 23.93% on recognizing unseen characters. For the handwritten characters, HCRN improves the mean accuracy by 11.25% on recognizing unseen characters.}

Here, we summarize recent experimental work examining cognitive mechanisms of network interactions and correlational studies assessing network dynamics associated with individual creative abilities. Our review identifies three cognitive processes related to network interactions during creative performance: goal-directed memory retrieval, prepotent-response inhibition, and internally-focused attention. Correlational work using prediction modeling indicates that functional connectivity between networks — particularly the executive control and default networks — can reliably predict an individual’s creative thinking ability. We discuss potential directions for future network neuroscience, including assessing creative performance in specific domains and using brain stimulation to test causal hypotheses regarding network interactions and cognitive mechanisms of creative thought.}

A many-body quantum-mechanical frame of thinking is proposed based on the concept of quantum coherence taking into account explicitly density and excitation frequencies of molecules and/or ionic species. It is also proposed that Hofmeister phenomena could have a natural explanation in the harmonic relationships between sets of characteristic frequencies ruled by quantum mechanical laws. It then follows that physical chemistry of concentrated media and biology should be ruled more by a quantum “symphony” between indistinguishable constituents rather than localized two-body electrical interactions between molecular or ionic species.}

Some of the recent method-development efforts by Chinese microbiome scientists and their international collaborators that underlie these technological trends are highlighted here.

abstract = {In 1972, Efim Liberman, a Soviet biophysicist, pioneered a brand-new approach to studying the operation of the brain, the live cell and the human mind by publishing a paper titled “Cell as a molecular computer” (1972). In this paper, Liberman posited that a consecutive/parallel stochastic molecular computer (MCC) controls a living cell. An MCC operates with molecule-words (DNA, RNA, proteins) according to the program recorded in DNA and RNA. Computational operations are implemented by molecular operators acting as enzymes. An MCC is present in each live cell. A neuron cell MCC can be involved in solving tasks for the entire organism. Neuron MCC investigation was started with studying an impact of an intracellular injection of cyclic AMP on electric activity of a neuron. Cyclic nucleotides were considered as input words for an MCC, which are generated inside a neuron as a result of synaptic activity. This led Efim Liberman to the idea that, in order to solve complex physical problems, which are encountered by a neuron and require rapid solutions, the molecular computer adjusts the operation of the quantum molecular regulator, which uses the “computational environment” of the cytoskeleton and quantum properties of the elementary hypersound quasiparticles for completing mathematical operations for the minimum price of action. Efim Liberman suggested that the human self-consciousness is a quantum computer of even a higher level and designated it as an extreme quantum regulator. In order to describe such systems, he suggested to join biology, physics and mathematics into a unified science, and formulated its four fundamental principles. Results of Efim Liberman’s theoretical and experimental studies on the topic of biological computation are summarized in this review.}

Conventional computational methods frequently struggle to address the complex nature of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), lacking the ability to balance global search with local optimization and failing to prioritize goals related to sustainability. To address these restrictions, this work introduces the Integrated Bioinspired Computing Model for Sustainable Development (IBCMSD). By combining Genetic Algorithms (GAs), Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), a cohesive hybrid model is developed that improves exploration and exploitation, balance for increased efficiency, and solution quality. It is implemented on High-Performance Computing (HPC) clusters to ensure scalability and resilience when dealing with complicated optimization challenges. Furthermore, using a multidisciplinary co-design method completes the model with multiple views, increasing its relevance and applicability in real-world circumstances. IBCMSD makes a significant contribution to computational sustainability by leveraging bioinspired computing, potentially enabling informed decision-making and SDG accomplishment across multiple domains.}

To improve the validity and reliability of consumer acceptance measurement, a new indirect scaling method, the ‘Degree of Satisfaction-Difference (DOSD)’, was developed using a reminder design and signal detection theory (SDT). In DOSD, a product-specified ‘cognitive warm-up’ was used to evoke the consumer personal context and the internal evaluative criteria prior to product evaluation. In DOSD, each test product was presented together with a fixed-reference (identified as such) and consumers were asked to evaluate their satisfaction with the reference first with a sureness rating, and then to evaluate the test product for both absolute satisfaction and comparative satisfaction to the reference. The reliability of DOSD was tested against traditional hedonic scaling using an independent samples design of two consumer groups with equivalent cognitive reflection test profiles, each including High Reflection Thinkers (HRTs) and Low Reflection Thinkers (LRTs) in equal proportion. Each group tested two sets of skin lotions differing in product range, either using DOSD or hedonic scaling. When examining the affective discriminations of the two common products in terms of d′ values between product sets, the LRT subjects generated inconsistent responses with hedonic scaling, but reproducible responses with DOSD. The HRT subjects performed consistently using both scaling methods. These results validate DOSD’s superior reliability in affective tests and demonstrate its potential as an alternative consumer acceptance measurement to hedonic scaling.}

In order to reach this goal, the following intellectual traditions are introduced to review the philosophical and historical contexts that affect the very foundations of futures studies: (a) religions, (b) utopias, (c) historicism, (d) science fiction, and (e) systems thinking. The first phase (beginning in 1945 to the 1960s) was the era of scientific inquiry and rationalization of the futures characterized by the prevalence of technological forecasting, the rise of alternative futures in systematic ways, and the growth of professionalization of futures studies. In the first phase, futures had become objects of rationalization removed from the traditional approaches such as utopia, grandiose evolutionary ideas, naive prophecies, science fiction, religious attitudes, and mystical orientation. The second phase (the 1970s and the 1980s) saw the creation the global institution and industrialization of the futures. This era was marked by the rise of worldwide discourse on global futures, the development of normative futures, and the deep involvement of the business community in futures thinking. In the second phase, futures studies-industry ties were growing and the future-oriented thoughts extensively permeated the business decision-making process. The third phase (the 1990s – the present) reflects the current era of the neoliberal view and fragmentation of the futures. This phase is taking place in the time of neoliberal globalization and risk society discourses and is characterized by the dominance of foresight, the advance of critical futures studies, and the intensification of fragmentation. In the third phase, futures practice tends to be confined to the support of strategic planning, and hence is experiencing an identity crisis and loss of its earlier status of humanity-oriented futures.}

The other, the Colemanian, looks to interpersonal networks as the core of social capital. We argue that the most common way of articulating how humans use these types of relationships in different ways—the distinction between “bridging” and “bonding” social capital—is epistemically unstable. What might be possible, however, is to use the insights developed by Ronald Burt regarding tie non-redundancy to study associational social capital. We do this by drawing on the insights of the approach consistently adopted and developed by John Mohr, which emphasizes duality and diversity, to develop measures of group affiliation-based social capital. We accordingly, for both Tocquevillian and Colemanian social capital, distinguish measures that focus on the mass of social capital from those that focus on its diversity. To illustrate, we use de-identified data from 77 Million U.S. Facebook Groups users to measure their degree of all resulting types of social capital. We show that our understanding of who has the most social capital varies greatly by whether we are considering Tocquevillian or Colemanian capital, and whether we are focusing on mass or diversity.}

abstract = {In this paper, we make a case for computing as a mathematical disciplinary practice. We present results from interviews with research mathematicians in which they reflected on the use of computing in their professional work. We draw on their responses to present evidence that computing is an inherent part of doing mathematics and is a practice they want their students to develop. We also discuss the mathematicians’ perspectives on how they learned and teach computing, and we suggest that much needs to be explored about how to teach computing effectively. Our overarching goal is to draw attention to the importance of the teaching and learning of computing, and we argue that it is an imperative topic of study in mathematics education research.}

Companies often use an incident data reporting system to execute PSM. While companies keep incident data in thousands of reports, rarely do they glean full value in learning from these to prevent and reduce future incidents. To overcome this challenge, this research applied machine learning and keyword analysis to label and classify 8199 incident reports from an oil and gas company into nine groups identified in the latest version of PSM guidelines published by the Center for Chemical Process Safety (CCPS). To converge on an optimal solution, two different Bayesian network techniques (Tabu and hill climbing) were applied. Both methods resulted in the same map, showing that the Total Number of Incidents has the maximum dependency (50%) on Asset Integrity & Reliability; this means focusing resources on this aspect could reduce the total number of incidents by half. Cross correlation analysis (CCA) was also applied, which validated and confirmed this result. This analysis identifies which measures enhance the company’s safety management strategy to reduce these latent causes, but also supports critical thinking, enhanced communication, and learning culture to improve organizational safety.}

There is a concern, however, that while new computers will derive their computational speed through parallel processing, current algorithmic procedures that have roots in serial thinking are poor candidates for use on such machines—a paradigm shift is required! Among new advances in computational methods, soft computing techniques have enjoyed a remarkable period of development and growth. Of these, methods of neural computing, evolutionary search, and fuzzy logic have been the most extensively explored in problems of multidisciplinary analysis and design. The paper will summarize important accomplishments to-date, of neurocomputing, fuzzy logic, and evolutionary search, including immune network modeling, in the field of multidisciplinary aerospace design.}

The presence of a nearby tethered functional group (G, G = tertiary amide or amine) can significantly impact the rate of cleavage of an Si–O bond. We report here an in situ1H NMR spectroscopic investigation of the relative rates of cleavage of model substrates containing two different Si–O substructures, namely alkoxydisiloxanes [GRO–Si­(Me2)–O–SiMe3] and carbodisiloxanes [GR–Si­(Me2)–O–SiMe3]. The trends in the relative rates (which slowed with increasing chain length, with a notable exception) of alkoxydisiloxane hydrolyses were probed via computation. The results correlated well with the experimental data. In contrast to the hydrolysis of the alkoxydisiloxanes, the carbodisiloxanes were not fully hydrolyzed, but rather formed an equilibrium mixture of starting asymmetric disiloxane, two silanols, and a new symmetrical disiloxane. We also uncovered a facile siloxy-metathesis reaction of an incoming silanol with the carbodisiloxane substrate [e.g., Me2NR–Si­(Me2)–O–SiMe3 + HOSiEt3 ⇋ Me2NR–Si­(Me2)–O–SiEt3 + HOSiMe3] facilitated by the pendant dimethylamino group, a process that was also probed by computation.}

In particular, such connectomic thinking expands our ability to improve patient functional outcomes after surgery beyond mere motor and language functions by also considering the anatomy responsible for complex cognitive functions. We introduce the concept of “disconnection surgery,” where the surgical decisions when removing a tumor can be thought of a series of specific cuts that we plan to perform on the periphery of the tumor such that we can disconnect the tumor from the surrounding networks. Connectomics allows us to define the risks associated with specific tumors and surgical decisions, which can subsequently guide the operation but also tailor preoperative patient discussion. Novel mathematical concepts from the field of network neuroscience on graph theory are also introduced so as to better define truly eloquent brain regions on an individualized basis.}

abstract = {Climate change research and action counteracting it affect everyone and would involve cross-societal transformations reshaping the anthroposphere in its entirety. Scrutinizing climate-related science and policies, we recognize attempts to steer the evolution of climate according to expected (or modelled) futures. Such attempts would turn the anthroposphere into a large “anticipatory system”, in which human society seeks to anticipate and, possibly, to govern climate dynamics. The chief aim of this discussion paper is to open a critical debate on the climate change paradigm (CCP) drawing on a strategic and systemic framework grounded in the concept of anticipatory system sensu Rosen (1991). The proposed scheme is ambitiously intended to turn an intricate issue into a complex but structured problem that is to say, to make such complexity clear and manageable. This framework emerges from concepts borrowed from different scientific fields (including future studies and system dynamics) and its background lies in a simple quantitative literature overview, relying upon a broad level of analysis. The proposed framework will assist researchers and policy makers in thinking of CCP in terms of an anticipatory system, and in disentangling its interrelated (and sometimes intricate) aspects. In point of fact, several strategic questions related to CCP were not subjected to an adequate transdisciplinary discussion: what are the interplays between physical processes and social-political interventions, who is the observer (what he/she is looking for), and which paradigm is being used (or who defines the desirable future). The proposed scheme allows to structure such various topics in an arrangement which is easier to communicate, highlighting the linkages in between, and making them intelligible and open to verification and discussion. Furthermore, ideally developments will help scientists and policy makers address the strategic gaps between the evidence-based climatological assessments and the plurality of possible answers as applied to the geopolitical contingencies.}

This study details these and teachers’ less commonly used knowledge resources, as well as counterproductive statements related to the knowledge resources. We analyze the structure of the comparison proportion problem and suggest why teachers drew on particular knowledge resources.

abstract = {Bio-inspired design was introduced as an alternative method to encourage breakthrough innovations during design projects by stimulating analogical reasoning and thinking of designers. However, the method did not perform as well as researchers expected because most designers, who are novices in the fields of biology and ecology, cannot infer the proper analogue (i.e. biological system) from nature. To resolve this fundamental problem, a causal model based representation framework for ‘analogical reasoning’ – searching and selecting the biological systems to apply – have been developed. In addition, ontology based repository structures and retrieval systems have been proposed to support ‘analogical thinking’ of designers. Nevertheless, these systematic approaches still restrict the candidates and inevitably lose potential biological systems relevant to the design project, due to the ‘physical relation’ biased problem and the ambiguity of the indexing mechanism of both current representation frameworks and retrieval systems. For example, the causality based support system known as a robust representation framework for a single biological system, stores information of a biological system only by its internal ‘physical relations’ and retrieves biological systetabms only by the physical relevance. However, from the perspective of ecological thinking, the further relatedness of ‘physical, biological, and ecological relations’ composes the holistic concept used to identify an organism in the flow of evolution because the ‘biological and ecological relations’ are also involved in the traits that designers may be interested in. Therefore, the supplementary information for ‘biological and ecological relations’ must be added to index the biological and environmental interactions, and to use the connectivity among entire organisms in the retrieval process. In this research, a causality based holistic representation framework for biological systems and an ‘all-connected’ ontology based repository and retrieval system are developed as a knowledge-based recommendation system to support bio-inspired design. The knowledge-based system we developed allows engineering designers to search and select a particular biological system and extract design strategy without much biological knowledge. This effort provides more opportunities in a bio-inspired design process by adding potential biological systems that might previously not have been considered.}
