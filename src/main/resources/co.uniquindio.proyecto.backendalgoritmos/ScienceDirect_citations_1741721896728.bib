abstract = {This study investigated gender differences in 11 cognitive tests from a sample of grade 11 students in Shanghai, China. Research found that the girls outperformed boys significantly on Word Knowledge and Word Span tasks, and also on a Computational Speed and Accuracy test. Boys outperformed girls only on the Paper Folding test. Factor based scores showed that girls were superior to boys on memory, and verbal composites, whereas boys were superior to girls on the spatial composites. No gender differences were found on the Mathematical Thinking test and other reasoning tests. The research findings seemed to suggest that where the social conditions were more uniform the gender differences on visual-spatial and mathematical reasoning skills would be smaller.}

abstract = {Neural circuits have evolved to accommodate similar information processing challenges as those faced by engineered systems. Here, we compare neural versus engineering strategies for constructing networks. During circuit development, synapses are overproduced and then pruned back over time, whereas in engineered networks, connections are initially sparse and are then added over time. We provide a computational perspective on these two different approaches, including discussion of how and why they are used, insights that one can provide the other, and areas for future joint investigation. By thinking algorithmically about the goals, constraints, and optimization principles used by neural circuits, we can develop brain-derived strategies for enhancing network design, while also stimulating experimental hypotheses about circuit development and function.}

abstract = {As computational biology matures as a field, increasing attention is being paid to the relation of computational models to their target. One aspect of this is addressing how computational models can appropriately reproduce the variation seen in experimental data, with one solution being to use populations of models united by a common set of equations (the framework), with each individual member of the population (each model) possessing its own unique set of equation parameters. These model populations are then calibrated and validated against experimental data, and as a whole reproduce the experimentally observed variation. The primary focus of validation thus becomes the population, with the individual models' validation seemingly deriving from their membership of this population. The role of individual models within the population is not clear, with uncertainty regarding the relationship between individual models and the population they make up. This work examines the role of models within the population, how they relate to the population they make up, and how both can be said to be validated in this context.}

While there have been some surveys on the sustainability of energy production systems they have either tended to focus on one assessment approach or one type of energy generation technology. This study builds on previous studies by providing a broader and comprehensive examination of the literature across generation technologies and assessment methods. A systematic review of 128 scholarly articles covering a 20-year period, ending 2018, and gathered from ProQuest, Scopus, and manual search is conducted. Synthesis and critical evaluation of the reviewed papers highlight a number of research gaps that exist within the sustainable energy production systems research domain. In addition, using mapping and cluster analyses, the paper visually highlights the network of dominant research issues, which emerged from the review.}

abstract = {There are two related measures of sea level, the absolute sea level, which is the increase in the sea level in an absolute reference frame, and relative sea level, which is the increase in sea level recorded by tide gauges. The first measure is a rather abstract computation, far from being reliable, and is preferred by activists and politicians for no scientific reason. For local and global problems it is better to use local tide gauge data. Proper coastal management should be based on proved measurements of sea level. Tide gauges provide the most reliable measurements, and best data to assess the rate of change. We show as the naïve averaging of all the tide gauges included in the PSMSL surveys show “relative” rates of rise about +1.04 mm/year (570 tide gauges of any length). If we consider only 100 tide gauges with more than 80 years of recording the rise is only +0.25 mm/year. This naïve averaging has been stable and shows that the sea levels are slowly rising but not accelerating. We also show as the additional information provided by GPS and satellite altimetry is of very little help. Computations of “absolute” sea levels suffer from inaccuracies with errors larger than the estimated trends. The GPS is more reliable than satellite altimetry, but the accuracy of the estimation of the vertical velocity at GPS domes is still well above ±1 mm/year and the relative motion of tide gauges vs. GPS domes is mostly unassessed. The satellite altimetry returns a noisy signal so that a +3.2 mm/year trend is only achieved by arbitrary “corrections”. We conclude that if the sea levels are only oscillating about constant trends everywhere as suggested by the tide gauges, then the effects of climate change are negligible, and the local patterns may be used for local coastal planning without any need of purely speculative global trends based on emission scenarios. Ocean and coastal management should acknowledge all these facts. As the relative rates of rises are stable worldwide, coastal protection should be introduced only where the rate of rise of sea levels as determined from historical data show a tangible short term threat. As the first signs the sea levels will rise catastrophically within few years are nowhere to be seen, people should start really thinking about the warnings not to demolish everything for a case nobody knows will indeed happen.}

However, limited by the inherent thinking of human beings, it has always been difficult to build a pioneering architecture for rotating machinery fault diagnosis. In order to solve this problem, this paper uses reinforcement learning algorithm based on adjacency matrix to carry out network architecture search (NAS) of rotating machinery fault diagnosis model. A reinforcement learning agent for deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) is developed based on actor–critic neural networks. The observation state of reinforcement learning is used to develop the graph neural network (GNN) diagnosis model, and the diagnosis accuracy is fed back to the agent as a reward for updating the reinforcement learning parameters. The MFPT bearing fault datasets and the developed gear pitting fault experimental data are used to validate the proposed network architecture search method based on reinforcement learning (RL-NAS). The proposed method is proved to be practical and effective in various aspects such as fault diagnosis ability, search space, search efficiency and multi-working condition performance.}

The 13C NMR spectra and electron densities for the disulfonyl, nitro, and cyano carbon acids were calculated at the MP2/cc-pVDZ level of theory. The calculated chemical shifts for disulfonyl carbanions show satisfying correlation with our own experimental data. The calculated π electron densities at the Cα atom correspond roughly to the “experimental” π electron densities estimated from the 13C chemical shifts. The natural charges at Cα in disulfonyl stabilized carbanions are significantly more negative than with other types of carbanions, partly because of the significant negative natural charge of the α carbon in parent carbon acids. The calculated increase of the negative charge caused by ionization is larger for sulfonyl carbon acids than for cyano- and nitroalkanes. The 13C chemical shifts δ of Cα in disulfonyl stabilized carbanions decrease with more negative calculated negative natural charge at Cα, with a slope of 220ppm/electron. The influence of phenyl ring para-substitution on the charge distribution in carbanions and relationship between the 13C chemical shifts and charge density have been discussed. It appears that the π electron density in these planar or nearly planar carbanions has a decisive impact on the chemical shifts.}

However, it is impractical for firms with a diverse and extensive supplier base to strategize the SCF solutions for individual suppliers by assessing their financial risk. Hence, this study conceptualizes an intelligent method to demonstrate how supplier segmentation based on suppliers’ payment risk portfolios helps supply chain practitioners to assess suppliers’ financial risk and strategize manageable supply chain finance solutions for them. This method employs a stochastic optimization model to compute suppliers’ optimum payment risk portfolios and generate a supplier segmentation matrix to offer supply chain practitioners the cognitive ability to select appropriate SCF solutions for their suppliers. The proposed method can be implemented into an AI-driven explainable recommendation system to aid supply chain practitioners in applying smart strategic thinking in supply chain finance decision-making.}

PROANTAR, coordinated by the Navy Commander, has some sectors that are based in Brazil and others that are located in the Antarctic continent. The military that volunteers to occupy any vacancy that is allocated to that continent needs, besides passing through several pre-established criteria, to pass the selection process. The purpose of this article is to help the Naval Administration in the selection of volunteer officers to occupy a vacancy in the Antarctic continent. To obtain the alternatives, the officers that best fit the established vacancy, and the criteria to be evaluated, Value-Focused Thinking (VFT) was applied. Next, with all the necessary data, the CRITIC-GRA-3N method was used as a Multicriteria Decision Support (MDS) technique, the CRITIC-GRA-3N method, the CRITIC Importance Through Intercriteria Correlation (CRITIC) method to obtain the criteria weights and the Grey Relational Analysis (GRA) method, with three normalizations, to order the alternatives. At the end of the application of the methods, the article can generate five ordinations of the volunteer officers to occupy the vacancy offered in PROANTAR.}

Counterparts to computational science such as computational linguistice, computational engineering and others arc beginning to take roots. Naturally, new research paths and opportunities in computational epidemiology must also be explored. One of the major challenges in epidemiologic research is the issue of how to realistically and effectively handle complex bioepidemiologic dynamics involving interactions between humans or animals, etiological agents and the multiple array of environmental and socioeconomic determinants which affect these populations. To understand the behavior of such complex biological systems, it is useful to devise computer based simulation models. Computational epidemiologic approaches now provide alternative avenues to classical laboratory and/or field experimental methods. Systems which may be impractical because they are too large, or, not feasible because the cost is too prohibitive can now be simulated realistically. In the past obtaining solutions to biomathematical equations with any degree of complexity was impossible. However, the availability of powerful computers now makes the quantitative analysis of such systems feasible and indeed practical. With this in mind our research at Tuskegee University has focused on: a) Epidemiologic modelling and expert systems, and, b) Hypertext/hypermedia based epidemiologic knowledge management. The case studies for our research involve the bioepidemiologic dynamics of two complex host-parasite systems of trypanosoma and schistosoma. The ultimate goal is to develop resources and methodologies based on computational technology to advance epidemiologic research. The paper will address the methodological issues and findings as well as questions related to configuring an appropriate research workstation for computational epidemiology.}

abstract = {Objective
During initial assessment of trauma patients, metrics of heart rate variability (HRV) have been associated with high-risk clinical conditions. Yet, despite numerous studies, the potential of HRV to improve clinical outcomes remains unclear. Our objective was to evaluate whether HRV metrics provide additional diagnostic information, beyond routine vital signs, for making a specific clinical assessment: identification of hemorrhaging patients who receive packed red blood cell (PRBC) transfusion.
Methods
Adult prehospital trauma patients were analyzed retrospectively, excluding those who lacked a complete set of reliable vital signs and a clean electrocardiogram for computation of HRV metrics. We also excluded patients who did not survive to admission. The primary outcome was hemorrhagic injury plus different PRBC transfusion volumes. We performed multivariate regression analysis using HRV metrics and routine vital signs to test the hypothesis that HRV metrics could improve the diagnosis of hemorrhagic injury plus PRBC transfusion vs routine vital signs alone.
Results
As univariate predictors, HRV metrics in a data set of 402 subjects had comparable areas under receiver operating characteristic curves compared with routine vital signs. In multivariate regression models containing routine vital signs, HRV parameters were significant (P < .05) but yielded areas under receiver operating characteristic curves with minimal, nonsignificant improvements (+0.00 to +0.05).
Conclusions
A novel diagnostic test should improve diagnostic thinking and allow for better decision making in a significant fraction of cases. Our findings do not support that HRV metrics add value over routine vital signs in terms of prehospital identification of hemorrhaging patients who receive PRBC transfusion.}

However, despite the large number of accessibility measures available in the literature, they are not widely used to support urban planning practices. Much has been said about the implementation gap of Planning Support Systems with a significant attention paid to usability and more recently to the usefulness of Accessibility Instruments. The paper aims to assess the usefulness of a specific accessibility instrument – the Structural Accessibility Layer (SAL) – and by doing so exploring the strengths of accessibility instruments holding similar characteristics. To this end, we follow a multidimensional assessment framework under development in the Planning Support System literature. This paper explores the main findings of a workshop bringing together local planning practitioners and the developers of the SAL in an experiment using the SAL. The assessment of usefulness of SAL identified the instrument’s strengths with regard to insight into participants’ assumptions, communication, commitment and development of shared language. Regardless, the low fit between planning concerns of participants (in this case study context) and of the SAL seemed to limit its potential use in practice and as such undermines the strengths identified in the usefulness assessment. The assessment developed here only partially confirmed objectives and purposes defined for the SAL. Results confirm the usefulness of the SAL as diagnosis tool, however, the ability of the SAL to contribute to a joint thinking of land use and transport constraints on mobility was not confirmed. Finally, this research raises questions on the role of PSS in changing strategic thinking in planning and how this might conflict with the current PSS research concern in improving usefulness of tools.}

The charge transfer phenomenon from magnesium to indium is found for the first time, and the s-orbital density of indium is at its peak in the Mg-In phase. In terms of mechanical properties, Mg2In, Mg5In2, and MgIn3 exhibit similar bulk moduli, while the shear modulus, Young's modulus, and hardness of MgIn3 are significantly lower than those of the other phases, emphasizing its unique deformability. Taking the results together, MgIn3 shows great potential for application in cutting-edge fields such as biomedical materials due to its compact size, corrosion resistance, low hardness, and high plasticity, which opens up a new way of thinking for the development of Mg-In alloy-based advanced materials.}

In this study, seventy-five participants completed the creative behaviour inventory, a tool for assessing creative behaviour in daily life. The participants also completed the alternate uses task (AUT) during an electroencephalography (EEG) assessment to evaluate creative thinking. Alpha power was used to quantify neural oscillations during the creative process, while alpha coherence was used to quantify information communication between frontal regions and other sites during creative ideation. Moreover, these two task-related quantitative measures were combined to investigate the relationship between individual differences in everyday creativity and EEG alpha activity during creative idea generation. Compared with the reference period, increased alpha power was observed in the frontal cortex of the right hemisphere and increased functional coupling was observed between frontal and parietal/temporal regions during the activation period. Interestingly, individual differences in everyday creativity were associated with distinct patterns of EEG alpha activity. Specifically, individuals with higher everyday creativity had increased alpha power in the frontal cortex, and increased changes in coherence in frontal-temporal regions of the right hemisphere while performing the AUT. It might indicate that individuals with higher everyday creativity had an enhanced ability to focus on internal information processing and control bottom-up stimuli, as well as better selection of novel semantic information when performing creative ideation tasks.}

abstract = {This study aims to map the research literature on musical creativity that was published from 1990 to 2022 by using metadata extracted from 1,177 Web of Science-indexed publications in terms of trends in publications and citations data, leading journals, authors, institutions/organizations, and countries, collaborative networks between authors, institutions, and countries, and trends in keyword frequencies and co-occurrences. The main findings of this study are that (1) research on musical creativity has undergone an incipient phase and has had a growing scientific interest since the mid-2000s, (2) musical creativity is a relatively more specific research field compared to general creativity research that has been represented by more specific sub-fields, e.g., music psychology and ethnomusicology, (3) a small number of scholars – especially from the USA, England, Russia, Spain, Australia, and some countries from South Europe – have made the more impactful contribution as regards musical creativity, (4) there is a small number of research collaborations among scholars, yet the collaborative networks among countries and institutions occur intercontinentally, (5) musical creativity research is growing with cross-disciplinary links with several branches of psychology, neurosciences, cognitive sciences, education, sociology, arts and humanities, and computer sciences, and (6) eight main topical foci have been founded in the literature from 1990 to date – i.e., computational creativity, processes of improvisation, improvisation teaching and learning, interactions/collaboration during improvisation, effects of improvisation practice, innovative music technology, esthetic aspect of everyday creativity, and music therapy. Further research on musical creativity could map the literature by focusing on contextual themes.}

This study compares the psychiatric symptoms of patients reporting ATS use only, ATS and ketamine use, or ketamine use only who were admitted to an inpatient psychiatry ward in Wuhan, China between 2010 and 2011. Data on 375 study participants collected during their ward admission and extracted from their clinical records included their socio-demographics, scores on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), and urine toxicology screens.
Results
The ketamine-only group had significantly lower total BPRS scores and significantly lower scores on Thinking Disorder, Activity, and Hostility-Suspicion BPRS subscales than the ATS-only and ATS + ketamine groups (p < 0.001 for all comparisons). The ketamine-only group also had significantly higher scores on the subscales of Anxiety-Depression and Anergia. The ATS-only group had significantly higher scores on subscales of Thinking Disorder, Activity, and Hostility-Suspicion and significantly lower scores on Anxiety-Depression and Anergia subscales than the ketamine-only and ATS + ketamine groups (p < 0.001 for all comparisons). A K-means cluster method identified three distinct clusters of patients based on the similarities of their BPRS subscale profiles, and the identified clusters differed markedly on the proportions of participants reporting different primary drugs of abuse. The study findings suggest that ketamine and ATS users present with different profiles of psychiatric symptoms at admission to inpatient treatment.}

In this work, two promising approaches for boosting CAI are described. One regards designing and implementing neural surrogates that can communicate through optical or chemical signals and give rise to networks for computational purposes and to develop micro/nanorobotics. The other approach concerns “bottom-up synthetic cells” that can be exploited for applications in various scenarios, including future nano-medicine. Both topics are presented at a basic level, mainly to inform the broader audience of non-specialists, and so favour the rise of interest in these frontier subjects.}

Mathematical modeling approaches for analyzing kinetics and dynamics, including deterministic, stochastic, and hybrid models, are presented. Experimental techniques like transport measurements, calorimetry, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, and neutron scattering are highlighted for investigating kinetics and dynamics. Computational methods such as molecular dynamics simulations and deep learning are also explored for studying biomolecular processes. Applications of kinetics and dynamics are illustrated through examples in areas like fuel-driven dynamic combinatorial libraries, self-assembly, and gene regulatory networks. Key discoveries enabled by kinetics and dynamics research are summarized, including dynamic heterogeneity, kinetic proofreading, biological switches, and single-molecule insights. The chapter emphasizes on the importance of integrating experimental data with computational modeling to deepen the understanding of biological systems across multiple scales. Future directions are outlined, such as studying interactomes, DNA mechanics, metabolic regulation, and developing advanced microtechnologies to further unravel the complex kinetic and dynamic behavior underlying diverse biological phenomena.}

Alzheimer is the most general form of dementia in the elderly. Recently, biomotivated techniques have become famous in the domain of healthcare and have obtained appreciable success. This review shows that these techniques are mostly utilized to resolve various problems such as image segmentation, feature selection, classification, and optimization in the detection of various disorders like cancer, anemia, Alzheimer, kidney and skin diseases. It is observed that the dementia diagnosis was performed using classical approaches which led to reduced performance (accuracy, precision). This performance parameter can be enhanced by using biomotivated techniques. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the different role of biomotivated metaheuristics in the domain of dementia diagnosis with a detailed analysis of published work. The results showed that a biomotivated technique plays an important role in dementia diagnosis.}

The research focuses on reasoning, rather than learning, along three dimensions: quantitative, qualitative, and semi-quantitative. It provides a 3 × 2 classification of tasks according to modes of learning and types of reasoning. Modelling tools were developed for the study and descriptions of these are given. The research examined children's reasoning with tools in all three dimensions looking more exhaustively at the semi-quantitative. Pupils worked either in an exploratory mode or an expressive mode on one of the following topics: Traffic, Health and Diet, and Shops and Profits. They spent 3–4 h individually with a researcher over 2 weeks, carrying out four different activities: reasoning without the computer; learning to manipulate first the computer then later the tool and finally carrying out a task with the modelling tool. Pupils were between 12 and 14 yr. Research questions both about children's reasoning when working with or creating models and about the nature of the tools used are discussed. Finally an analytic scheme is set out which describes the nature of the causal and non-causal reasoning observed together with some tentative results.}

The hypothesis that thinking involves the application of syntax-sensitive inference rules to syntactically structured mental representations has been said to satisfy all three conditions. An alternative hypothesis is that thinking requires the construction and manipulation of the cognitive equivalent of scale models. A reading of this hypothesis is provided that satisfies condition (1) and which, even though it may not fully satisfy condition (2), turns out (in light of the frame problem) to be the only known way to satisfy condition (3).}

abstract = {It is now well established that depth is coded by local horizontal disparity and global vertical disparity. We present a computational model which explains how depth is extracted from these two types of disparities. The model uses the two (one for each eye) headcentric directions of binocular targets, derived from retinal signals and oculomotor signals. Headcentric disparity is defined as the difference between headcentric directions of corresponding features in the left and right eye’s images. Using Helmholtz’s coordinate systems we decompose headcentric disparity into azimuthal and elevational disparity. Elevational disparities of real objects are zero if the signals which contribute to headcentric disparity do not contain any errors. Azimuthal headcentric disparity is a 1D quantity from which an exact equation relating distance and disparity can be derived. The equation is valid for all headcentric directions and for all binocular fixation positions. Such an equation does not exist if disparity is expressed in retinal coordinates. Possible types of errors in oculomotor signals (six) produce global elevational disparity fields which are characterised by different gradients in the azimuthal and elevational directions. Computations show that the elevational disparity fields uniquely characterise both the type and size of the errors in oculomotor signals. Our model uses a measure of the global elevational disparity field together with local azimuthal disparity to accurately derive headcentric distance throughout the visual field. The model explains existing data on whole-field disparity transformations as well as hitherto unexplained aspects of stereoscopic depth perception.}

Inspired by a close investigation of the primary sources and archival material of a few historical actors, this paper lays out a framework on analogy-making which preserves as much as possible its historical complexity. While not losing sight of the logical role, our framework puts a special emphasis on the heuristic process, and aims at offering to the historian and philosopher of science as well as the physicist some tools to capture the subtle functions of analogical reasoning involved in such a process. After having traced it out theoretically, we make use of this framework to interpret the growth of the ideas of two remarkable physicists dealing with the multifaceted notion of vacuum in 20th century physics. We first consider the trajectory followed by John A. Wheeler, between the 1960s and 1970s, towards (in his own words) a “geology of the vacuum”; and then examine, starting from the hitherto neglected Japanese reception of the idea of Dirac sea in the early 1930s, the pathway that led Yoichiro Nambu to the discovery of spontaneous symmetry breaking.}

Previous work suggests that certain statistical regularities in speech could help infants segment the speech stream into words, thereby forming a proto-lexicon that could support learning of the eventual vocabulary. However, computational models of word segmentation have typically been tested using language input that is much less variable than actual speech is. We show that using actual, transcribed pronunciations rather than dictionary pronunciations of the same speech leads to worse segmentation performance across models. We also find that phonologically variable input poses serious problems for lexicon building, because even correctly segmented word forms exhibit a complex, many-to-many relationship with speakers' intended words. Many phonologically distinct word forms were actually the same intended word, and many identical transcriptions came from different intended words. The fact that previous models appear to have substantially overestimated the utility of simple statistical heuristics suggests a need to consider the formation of the lexicon in infancy differently.}

The evidence suggests that early Homo erectus s.l. was equipped with a computational capacity for premodern language. The same species developed Acheulean toolmaking and showed signs of a symbolic and aesthetic mind at about half a mya.

abstract = {Accidents are now widely acknowledged to be a systems phenomenon. As part of a proactive approach to safety management, organisations use risk assessment methods to identify the hazards and associated risks that may lead to accidents. Although there is an extensive body of literature on the need for a systems thinking approach in accident analysis, little has been said regarding the theoretical underpinnings of risk assessment methods. The aim of this paper was to systematically review the risk assessment methods presented in the literature and evaluate the extent to which they are underpinned by a systems thinking approach. A total of 342 methods spanning a range of safety-critical domains were evaluated using Rasmussen’s tenets of accident causation. A key finding is that the majority of existing risk assessment methods are not consistent with Rasmussen’s model of accident causation (arguably the most popular model in safety science circles). Instead, the majority of risk assessment methods focus on risks at the so called sharp-end and largely view accidents as emerging from a linear, or chain-of-events process. This overlooks emergent risks at other levels of the system, including supervisory, managerial, regulatory and government levels. The findings therefore suggest that the majority of existing risk assessment methods may be inadequate for identifying hazards and analysing risks within complex sociotechnical systems. The implications for risk assessment practice are discussed.}

Pressing concerns for research, therefore, are to detail students’ progressively sophisticated ways of reasoning and instructional design heuristics that can facilitate this process. In this article we analyze the case of student reasoning with analytic expressions as they reinvent solutions to systems of two differential equations. The significance of this work is twofold: it includes an elaboration of the Realistic Mathematics Education instructional design heuristic of emergent models to the undergraduate setting in which symbolic expressions play a prominent role, and it offers teachers insight into student thinking by highlighting qualitatively different ways that students reason proportionally in relation to this instructional design heuristic.}

We thus argue that studying goal selection is essential to advance our understanding of learning. By following existing literature in framing goal selection within a hierarchy of decision-making problems, we synthesize important findings on the principles underlying goal value attribution and exploration strategies. Ultimately, we propose that a goal-centric perspective will help develop more complete accounts of learning in both biological and artificial agents.}

TIE is the broadest scale, measuring all factors except Deprivation; NFC measures Intellectual Avoidance and Problem Solving, plus Abstract Thinking and Deprivation to a lesser degree; and EC largely measures Deprivation. Moreover, Reading may not fit in the IC domain; higher-order factor analysis indicated that, whereas items measuring Reading loaded more strongly on their first-order factor, items measuring the other factors strongly loaded on a general factor of IC.

abstract = {Objective
Computational fluid dynamics have been used to study the hemodynamic performance of surgical operations, resulting in improved design. Efficient designs with minimal energy losses are especially important for cavopulmonary connections. The purpose of this study was to compare hydraulic performance between the hemi-Fontan and bidirectional Glenn procedures, as well as the various types of completion Fontan operations.
Methods
Three-dimensional models were constructed of typical hemi-Fontan and bidirectional Glenn operations according to anatomic data derived from magnetic resonance scans, angiocardiograms, and echocardiograms. Boundary conditions were imposed, and fluid dynamics were calculated from a mathematic code. Power losses, flow distribution to each lung, and pressures were measured at three predetermined levels of pulmonary arteriolar resistance. Models of the lateral tunnel, total cavopulmonary connection, and extracardiac conduit completion Fontan operations were constructed, and power losses, total flow distribution, vena caval and pulmonary arterial pressures, and flow distribution of inferior vena caval return were calculated.
Results
The hemi-Fontan and bidirectional Glenn procedures performed nearly identically, with similar power losses and nearly equal flow distributions to each lung at all levels of pulmonary arteriolar resistance. However, the lateral tunnel Fontan procedure as performed after the hemi-Fontan operation had lower power losses (6.9 mW, pulmonary arteriolar resistance 3 units) than the total cavopulmonary connection (40.5 mW) or the extracardiac conduit (42.9 mW), although the inclusion of an enlargement patch toward the right in the total cavopulmonary connection was effective in reducing the difference (10.0 mW). Inferior vena caval flow to the right lung was 52% for the lateral tunnel, compared with 19%, 30%, 19%, and 15% for the total cavopulmonary connection, total cavopulmonary connection with right-sided enlargement patch, extracardiac conduit, and extracardiac conduit with a bevel to the left lung, respectively.
Conclusions
According to these methods, the hemi-Fontan and bidirectional Glenn procedures performed equally well, but important differences in energy losses and flow distribution were found after the completion Fontan procedures. The superior hydraulic performance of the lateral tunnel Fontan operation after the hemi-Fontan procedure relative to any other method may be due to closer to optimal caval offset achieved in the surgical reconstruction.}

Thus, this paper is about the use of systems thinking and systems theory in EA and about how it is possible to reconcile and understand, based on a single overarching framework, the interplay of two major enterprise change endeavours: on one hand enterprise engineering (i.e. deliberate change) and on the other hand evolutionary, organic change. The paper also demonstrates how such change processes can be illustrated by employing systems thinking to construct dynamic business models; the evolution of these concepts is exemplified using past applications in networked enterprise building, and more recent proposals in environmental-, disaster- and healthcare management. Finally, the paper attempts to plot the way GERAM, as a framework to think about the creation and evolution of complex socio-technical systems, will continue to contribute to the society in the context of future challenges and emerging opportunities.}

Although modern computational techniques for data analysis such as simulation, randomization, and bootstrapping have the potential to make the idea of randomness more concrete, representing such random processes with R code is not as easy for students to understand as is something like a coin-flip, which is both concrete and embodied. In this study, in the context of multimedia learning, we designed and tested the efficacy of an instructional sequence that preceded computational simulations with embodied demonstrations. We investigated the role that embodied hands-on movement might play in facilitating students’ understanding of the shuffle function in R. Our findings showed that students who watched a video of hands shuffling data written on pieces of paper learned more from a subsequent live-coding demonstration of randomization using R than did students only introduced to the concept using R. Although others have found an advantage of students themselves engaging in hands-on activities, this study showed that merely watching someone else engage can benefit learning. Implications for online and remote instruction are discussed.}

abstract = {Dynamically changing real world applications, demands for rapid and accurate machine learning algorithm. In neural network based machine learning algorithms, radial basis function (RBF) network is a simple supervised learning feed forward network. With its simplicity, this network is highly suitable to model and control the nonlinear systems. Existing RBF networks in literature are applied to static applications and also faces challenges such as increased model size, neuron removal, improper center selection etc leading to erroneous output. To overcome the challenges and handle complex real world problems, this paper proposes a new optimum steepest descent based higher level learning radial basis function network (OSDHL-RBFN). The proposed OSDHL-RBFN implements major components inspired from the human brain for efficient learning, adaptive structure and accurate classification. Higher level learning and thinking components of the proposed network are sample deletion, neuron addition, neuron migration, sample navigation and neuroplasticity. These components helps the classifier to think before learning the samples and regulates the learning strategy. The knowledge gained from the trained samples are used by the network to identify the incomplete sample, optimal center and bond strength of hidden & output neurons. Adaptive network structure is employed to minimize classification error. The proposed work also uses optimum steepest descent method for weight parameter update to minimize the sum square error. OSDHL-RBFN is tested and evaluated in both static and dynamic environments on nine benchmark classification (binary and multiclass) problems for balanced, unbalanced, small, large, low dimensional and high dimensional datasets. The overall and class wise efficiency of OSDHL-RBFN is improved when compared to other RBFN’s in the literature. The performance results clearly show that the proposed OSDHL-RBFN reduces the architecture complexity and computation time compared to other RBFN’s. Overall, the proposed OSDHL-RBFN is efficient and suitable for dynamic real world applications in terms of detection time and accuracy. As a case study, OSDHL-RBFN is implemented in real time remote health monitoring application for classifying the various abnormality levels in vital parameters.}

I argue that thinking is contingent on the weightings of the synaptic connections between neuronal groups grounding it. In turn, socialization is a process of adjusting or conditioning the appropriate synaptic connection weightings. Both conscious (reasoning) and unconscious (intuitions) determinants of sociologically nontrivial actions derive from perceptual encounters with our sociophysical environment. In turn, agents—as social scientists use the term—simply do not exist. Finally, I appeal to neuroscientific evidence and show that we still qualify as agents, if only with regards to sociologically trivial actions.}

The proposed method formulates the state estimation based on the nest structure of DistFlow, which is used for power flow calculation in distribution systems due to the redundancy of less than 1. The use of μPMUs can significantly improve the accuracy of estimates. However, Distribution System Operators (DSOs) need to consider optimization constraints before deciding on the optimal location of μPMUs. To tackle this issue, this paper proposes the use of DPPBSO (Discrete Predator-Prey Brain Storm Optimization) of Evolutionary Computation (EC) to optimize the location of μPMUs. PPBSO is an extension method that applies the Predator-Prey strategy to Brain Storm Optimization (BSO), and DPPSO is the discrete version of PPBSO used in solving combinatorial optimization problems. The Predator-Prey strategy is critical in improving the solution candidates by intensifying and diversifying solution searches in EC. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in the IEEE 69-node distribution system.}

The present paper is focused on modelling the circular dichroism spectra of chiral buckybowls, combining topological aspects and the density functional theory. For the first time Ball Pivoting Algorithm was proposed to hook up the chemical topology to the DFT through the surface reconstruction. Particularly, the gaussian curvature of a constructed probe set of corannulene and sumanene derivatives was used as discriminant parameter to benchmark a list of 10 functionals (B3LYP, B97D, M06-2X, HSEH1PBE, wB97XD, CAM-B3LYP, LC-wPBE, TPSSTPSS, mPW1PW91 and APFD). The latter provide to be noticeably accurate to reproduce the curvature effect of the considered molecules. A TD-DFT/BOMD mixed approach provided a comprehensive overview of the spectral chiral pattern prediction trends when multiple DFT functionals are scanned. The preliminary topological analysis efforts were then recompensed with the very precise computed CD spectra, again APFD confirmed as the leader functional, this time for TD-DFT vertical transition calculations. Therefore, we strongly recommend the use of the of dispersion embedded APFD functional coupled with the 6–311++G(2d,2p) basis set for the computation of the functionalized chiral buckybowls ECD spectra. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The heterogeneity of this dimension and its overlap with neurocognitive deficits are still debated. Within the multicenter study of the Italian Network for Research on Psychoses, we investigated electrophysiological and neurocognitive correlates of disorganization and its component items to assess the heterogeneity of this dimension and its possible overlap with neurocognitive deficits. Resting state EEG was recorded in 145 stabilized SCZ and 69 matched healthy controls (HC). Spectral amplitude was averaged in ten frequency bands. Neurocognitive domains were assessed by MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB). RAndomization Graphical User software explored band spectral amplitude differences between groups and correlations with disorganization and MCCB scores in SCZ. Correlations between disorganization and MCCB scores were also investigated. Compared to HC, SCZ showed increased delta, theta, and beta 1 and decreased alpha 2 activity. A negative correlation between alpha 1 and disorganization was observed in SCZ. At the item level, only “N5” showed the same correlation. MCCB neurocognitive composite score was associated with disorganization, “P2” and “N5”. Our findings suggest only a partial overlap between disorganization and neurocognitive impairment. The association of alpha 1 with the “N5” item suggests that some aspects of disorganization could be underpinned by the impairment of basic neurobiological functions that are only partially evaluated using MCCB.}

The aim of this study is to present the possibilities of nurse education in the use of the Chat Generative Pre-training Transformer (ChatGPT) tool to support the documentation process.
Background
The success of the nursing process is based on the accuracy of nursing diagnoses, which also determine nursing interventions and nursing outcomes. Educating nurses in the use of artificial intelligence in the nursing process can significantly reduce the time nurses spend on documentation.
Design
Discussion paper.
Methods
We used a case study from Train4Health in the field of preventive care to demonstrate the potential of using Generative Pre-training Transformer (ChatGPT) to educate nurses in documenting the nursing process using generative artificial intelligence. Based on the case study, we entered a description of the patient's condition into Generative Pre-training Transformer (ChatGPT) and asked questions about nursing diagnoses, nursing interventions and nursing outcomes. We further synthesized these results.
Results
In the process of educating nurses about the nursing process and nursing diagnosis, Generative Pre-training Transformer (ChatGPT) can present potential patient problems to nurses and guide them through the process from taking a medical history, setting nursing diagnoses and planning goals and interventions. Generative Pre-training Transformer (ChatGPT) returned appropriate nursing diagnoses, but these were not in line with the North American Nursing Diagnosis Association – International (NANDA-I) classification as requested. Of all the nursing diagnoses provided, only one was consistent with the most recent version of the North American Nursing Diagnosis Association – International (NANDA-I). Generative Pre-training Transformer (ChatGPT) is still not specific enough for nursing diagnoses, resulting in incorrect answers in several cases.
Conclusions
Using Generative Pre-training Transformer (ChatGPT) to educate nurses and support the documentation process is time-efficient, but it still requires a certain level of human critical-thinking and fact-checking.}

abstract = {Nowadays, quantum computing has reached the engineering phase, with fully-functional quantum processors integrating hundreds of noisy qubits. Yet – to fully unveil the potential of quantum computing out of the labs into the business reality – the challenge ahead is to substantially scale the qubit number, reaching orders of magnitude exceeding thousands of fault-tolerant qubits. To this aim, the distributed quantum computing paradigm is recognized as the key solution for scaling the number of qubits. Indeed, accordingly to such a paradigm, multiple small-to-moderate-scale quantum processors communicate and cooperate for executing computational tasks exceeding the computational power of single processing devices. The aim of this survey is to provide the reader with an overview about the main challenges and open problems arising with distributed quantum computing from a computer and communications engineering perspective. Furthermore, this survey provides an easy access and guide towards the relevant literature and the prominent results in the field.}

On the basis of latent profile analysis, four groups of children were identified: The first group succeeded in commutativity tasks with concrete materials but in no other tasks; the second succeeded in commutativity tasks in both concrete and abstract conditions, but not in complement tasks; the third group succeeded in all commutativity tasks and in complement tasks with concrete materials, and the final group succeeded in all the tasks. The four groups of children suggest a developmental trend – (1) Knowledge of the commutativity and of the complement principles seems to develop from thinking in the context of specific quantities to thinking about more abstract symbols; (2) There may be an order of understanding of the principles – from the commutativity to the complement principle; (3) Children may acquire the knowledge of the commutativity principle in the more abstract tasks before they start to acquire the knowledge of the complement principle. This study contributes to the literature by showing that assessing additive reasoning in different ways and identifying profiles with classification analyses may be useful for educators to understand more about the developmental stage where each child is placed. It appears that a more fine-grained assessment of additive reasoning can be achieved by incorporating both concrete materials and relatively abstract symbols in the assessment.}

Though the distinction they introduced between intuitive and reflective thinking should have strong developmental implications, the developmental approach has rarely been used to refine or test these theories. In this article, I review several contemporary dual-process accounts of conditional reasoning that theorize the distinction between the two systems of reasoning as a contrast between heuristic and analytic processes, probabilistic and mental model reasoning, or emphasize the role of metacognitive processes in reflective reasoning. These theories are evaluated in the light of the main developmental findings. It is argued that a proper account of developmental phenomena requires the integration of the main strengths of these three approaches. I propose such an integrative theory of conditional understanding and argue that the modern dual-process framework could benefit from earlier contributions that made the same distinction between intuition and reflective thinking, such as Piaget’s theory.}

Using the example of CP, we examine stakeholders’ views of the benefits and costs of using AI as a diagnostic tool within the clinic. Through a series of in-depth interviews (n ​= ​20) with: clinicians, clinical researchers, data scientists, industry and support group representatives, we report stakeholder views regarding the adoption of this technology in a clinical setting. While most interviewees were supportive of employing CP as a diagnostic tool in some capacity we observed ambivalence around the potential for artificial intelligence to overcome diagnostic uncertainty in a clinical context. Thus, while there was widespread agreement amongst interviewees concerning the public benefits of AI assisted diagnosis, namely, its potential to increase diagnostic yield and enable faster more objective and accurate diagnoses by up skilling non specialists and thereby enabling access to diagnosis that is potentially lacking, interviewees also raised concerns about ensuring algorithmic reliability, expunging algorithmic bias and that the use of AI could result in deskilling the specialist clinical workforce. We conclude that, prior to widespread clinical implementation, on-going reflection is needed regarding the trade-offs required to determine acceptable levels of bias and conclude that diagnostic AI tools should only be employed as an assistive technology within the dysmorphology clinic.}

abstract = {High precision and low complexity control algorithm plays an important role in the developing of the end-effector instrumentation of different robot manipulators. In order to reduce the kinetic energy and the high-speed drift phenomenon of the repetitive motion tracking task, the robot manipulator needs to calibrate its configuration. In this paper, we formulate the configuration calibration of the robot manipulator for the repetitive motion task as a future quadratic programming optimization problem constrained with equality constraints, which is also regarded as a fundamental problem in artificial intelligence and modern control engineering. Zhang neural network, which is a canonical method, can be adopted to deal with the continuous form of the future optimization problem, named as temporally dependent quadratic programming problem with equality constraints. In order to overcome the issue of temporally dependent inverse computing, a novel Zhang neural network model and its uncertain disturbance tolerant model, which are termed as filtered reciprocal-kind Zhang neural network model and uncertain disturbance tolerant filtered reciprocal-kind Zhang neural network model, respectively, are proposed by integrating the energy-type cost function and Zhang neural network design formula for solving the temporally dependent quadratic programming problem with equality constraints in this paper. Based on the Euler discrete formula and the models, the discrete filtered reciprocal-kind Zhang neural network and the discrete uncertain disturbance tolerant filtered reciprocal-kind Zhang neural network algorithms are proposed for solving the future quadratic programming problem with equality constraints and the robot manipulator configuration calibration problem of repetitive motion. The convergence properties of the reciprocal-kind Zhang neural network model and its corresponding uncertain disturbance tolerant model are obtained by Lyapunov stability theory of nonlinear system and its corresponding perturbed system, while the convergence property of the filtered reciprocal-kind Zhang neural network model is analyzed by the limit thinking. For the repetitive motion task, three experiments for solving the configuration calibration problem of PUMA560, Kinova Jaco2, and Franka Emika Panda robot manipulators are performed to illustrate the effectiveness, robustness and superiority of our proposed discrete filtered reciprocal-kind Zhang neural network algorithms.}

Second, the journal acts as a transnational and transcontinental scholarly contact zone – a status that cannot be isolated from our choice to publish both Anglophone and Russophone analyses. And third, Russian Literature brings together a range of scholarly voices and genres that is unusually broad for a scholarly periodical, through a strategy of active editorial outreach to young talents and leading experts in the field.

Autonomous vehicles will share roads with human-driven vehicles until the transition to fully autonomous transport systems is complete. The critical challenge of improving mutual understanding between both vehicle types cannot be addressed only by feeding extensive driving data into data-driven models but by enabling autonomous vehicles to understand and apply common driving behaviors analogous to human drivers. Therefore, we designed and conducted two electroencephalography experiments for comparing the cerebral activities of human linguistics and driving understanding. The results showed that driving activates hierarchical neural functions in the auditory cortex, which is analogous to abstraction in linguistic understanding. Subsequently, we proposed a neural-informed, semantics-driven framework to understand common human driving behavior in a brain-inspired manner. This study highlights the pathway of fusing neuroscience into complex human behavior understanding tasks and provides a computational neural model to understand human driving behaviors, which will enable autonomous vehicles to perceive and think like human drivers.}

A critical, but unanswered question concerns the issue of monitoring and control: When do reasoners rely on the first, intuitive output and when do they engage more effortful thinking? We hypothesised that initial, intuitive answers are accompanied by a metacognitive experience, called the Feeling of Rightness (FOR), which can signal when additional analysis is needed. In separate experiments, reasoners completed one of four tasks: conditional reasoning (N=60), a three-term variant of conditional reasoning (N=48), problems used to measure base rate neglect (N=128), or a syllogistic reasoning task (N=64). For each task, participants were instructed to provide an initial, intuitive response to the problem along with an assessment of the rightness of that answer (FOR). They were then allowed as much time as needed to reconsider their initial answer and provide a final answer. In each experiment, we observed a robust relationship between the FOR and two measures of analytic thinking: low FOR was associated with longer rethinking times and an increased probability of answer change. In turn, FOR judgments were consistently predicted by the fluency with which the initial answer was produced, providing a link to the wider literature on metamemory. These data support a model in which a metacognitive judgment about a first, initial model determines the extent of analytic engagement.}

ML approaches with high prediction accuracies are discussed comprehensively. Based on the literature Gray-box models can provide useful insights by revealing the essential catalytic traits, factors, and circumstances that affect the results. They can also provide a practical solution by fusing the benefits of black-box algorithms, such as ensemble models and NNs, with feature importance analysis.

We previously documented that individual microtubules in the axons of cultured juvenile rodent neurons consist of a labile domain and a stable domain and that experimental depletion of tau results in selective shortening and partial stabilization of the labile domain. After first confirming these findings in adult axons, we sought to understand the mechanism that accounts for the formation and maintenance of these microtubule domains. We found that fluorescent tau and MAP6 ectopically expressed in RFL-6 fibroblasts predominantly segregate on different microtubules or different domains on the same microtubule, with the tau-rich ones becoming more labile than in control cells and the MAP6-rich ones being more stable than in control cells. These and other experimental findings, which we studied further using computational modeling with tunable parameters, indicate that these two MAPs do not merely bind to pre-existing stable and labile domains but actually create stable and labile domains on microtubules.}

abstract = {Enormous resources are invested in Europe for the transition into a sustainable, low carbon, and resilient society. In the construction sector, these concepts are slowly being applied to the renovation of the existing building stock by enforcing their deep and holistic renovation targeting sustainability, safety and resilience. Effectiveness of such an approach to the renovation with respect to traditional retrofit actions emerges when broadening the time frame of the analyses, shifting from the construction time to a life cycle perspective. In this case, the potential of the holistic approach becomes clear in reducing costs, impacts on the inhabitants and impacts on the environment over the building life cycle. Within such a new perspective, new technology options are needed to innovatively combine structural retrofit, architectural restyling and energy efficiency measures. Furthermore, a new design approach conjugating the principles of sustainability, safety and resilience over the building life cycle is required. In such a transition, synergistic and cooperative work of researchers, design professionals, and all the stakeholders in the construction sector is required. In this paper, the basic features of an expanded Life Cycle Thinking (eLCT) approach will be presented, which not only entails the use of recyclable/reusable materials, but also encourages interventions carried out from the outside the buildings to reduce building downtime and avoid inhabitant relocation. In addition, such an expanded LCT fosters the adoption of reparable, easy maintainable, adaptable and fully demountable solutions, such as those featuring dry, demountable and pre-fabricated components. Finally, it addresses the need to account for the End of Life scenario from the initial design stages to guarantee selective dismantling and reuse or recycle to reduce construction waste. Finally, a discussion on the main barriers and challenges in the transition towards this new approach to the renovation of existing building stock is briefly presented.}

Oxymorons play a significant role in various language-processing applications. This study represents a pioneering effort in the exploration of oxymorons in the Bengali language. A corpus-based study of oxymoron is a fundamental issue that has not been explored so far. A system has been proposed for the automated recognition of oxymorons from a given corpus. Frequency analysis, semantic similarity, and an antonym dictionary have been employed to discern oxymorons within the corpus. The system achieved promising results when tested on a Bengali corpus, and found 308 distinct oxymorons. A corpus-based descriptive statistics is measured in two different corpora. The most common oxymorons are ranked based on their frequency. Their notable presence underscores the importance of the Bengali language. This study aimed to explore fundamental questions concerning oxymorons, such as the automated detection of oxymorons within a corpus, descriptive statistics regarding oxymorons across languages, and the process of their construction and creation. Additionally, efforts were made to extract oxymorons from large language models using zero-shot prompts, but the results were not as promising compared to our proposed system.}

Human design activities are surveyed, and popular computer-aided design methodologies are examined. It is argued that semiotics has the potential to merge and unite various design approaches into one fundamental theory that is naturally interpretable and so comprehensible in terms of computer use. Reviewing related work in philosophy, psychology, and cognitive science provides a general and encompassing vision of the creativity phenomenon. Basic notions of algebraic semiotics are given and explained in terms of design. This is to define a model of the design creative process, which is seen as a process of semiosis, where concepts and their attributes represented as signs organized into systems are evolved, blended, and analyzed, resulting in the development of new concepts. The model allows us to formally describe and investigate essential properties of the design process, namely its dynamics and non-determinism inherent in creative thinking. A stable pattern of creative thought — analogical and metaphorical reasoning — is specified to demonstrate the expressive power of the modeling approach; illustrative examples are given. The developed theory is applied to clarify the nature of emergence in design: it is shown that while emergent properties of a product may influence its creative value, emergence can simply be seen as a by-product of the creative process. Concluding remarks summarize the research, point to some unresolved issues, and outline directions for future work.}

abstract = {Obtaining the momentum space associated with tachyonic “particles” from the Poincaré group manifold proves to be rather intricate, departing very much from the ordinary dual to Minkowski space directly parametrized by space-time translations of the Poincaré group. In fact, although described by the constants of motion (Noether invariants) associated with space-time translations, they depend non-trivially on the parameters of the rotation subgroup. However, once the momentum space is parametrized by the Noether invariants, it behaves as that of ordinary particles. On the other hand, the evolution parameter is no longer the one associated with time translation, whose Noether invariant, Po, is now a basic one. Evolution takes place in a spatial direction. These facts not only make difficult the computation of the corresponding representation, but also force us to a sound revision of several traditional ingredients related to Cauchy hypersurface, scalar product and, of course, causality. After that, the theory becomes consistent and could shed new light on some special physical situations like inflation or traveling inside a black hole.}

AI-based RNN models are employed to simulate and forecast the complex heat transfer behavior in these environments, offering a more precise and efficient analysis as compared to traditional numerical methods. The findings of the study highlights the intricate interactions among thermal radiation, porous media, and internal heat generation which plays an integral role in a number of industrial and engineering applications. Recurrent neural network (RNN) is validated to examine the temperature distribution efficiency in a new configuration of triangular, porous, moving fins. Various dimensionless parameters are analyzed for their impact on the effectiveness of portable, transparent, triangular fins. These parameters include permeability, radiation-conduction, Peclet number, thermo-geometric factors, convection-conduction, and surface temperature. The Lobatto III-A numerical technique for HTMPTHG is simulated computationally to provide the synthetic datasets. Then, the RNN supervised computational technique is applied to the generated datasets and the RNN outputs show negligible errors and closely align with numerical observations for all model variant. The effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) is rigorously proved through extensive experiments, demonstrating iterative convergence curves for mean squared error, control metrics of optimization and error distribution via histograms.The mean absolute percent error (MAPE), mean absolute error (MAE), and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) are all nearly zero, while the coefficient of determination (R2) is close to 1.Furthermore, there is strong evidence of the prediction accuracy and dependability of the RNN in the regression results for the HTMPTHG model.}

The spatial approximation combines an upwind finite volume method for the discretization of the convective fluxes with a classical Galerkin finite element method for the discretization of the diffusive fluxes. The resulting semi-discrete equations are time integrated with a second-order low-storage explicit Runge-Kutta method. A communication efficient strategy for mapping thousands of processors onto an arbitrary mesh is presented and proposed as an alternative to the fast north-east-west-south (NEWS) communication mechanism, which is restricted to structured grids. Measured performance results for the simulation of low Reynolds number chaotic flows indicate that an 8K CM-2 (8192 processors) with single precision floating point arithmetic is at least as fast as one CRAY-2 processor.}

Based on a cross-validation based predictive framework, we searched from the whole-brain connectome (34,716 functional connectivities) and whole genome data (309,996 SNPs) in two datasets (all collected by Southwest University, Chongqing) consisting of altogether 236 subjects, for a better understanding of the brain and genetic underpinning of creativity. Using the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking score, we found that high figural creativity is mainly related to high functional connectivity between the executive control, attention, and memory retrieval networks (strong top-down effects); and to low functional connectivity between the default mode network, the ventral attention network, and the subcortical and primary sensory networks (weak bottom-up processing) in the first dataset (consisting of 138 subjects). High creativity also correlates significantly with mutations of genes coding for both excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters. Combining the brain connectome and the genomic data we can predict individuals' creativity scores with an accuracy of 78.4%, which is significantly better than prediction using single modality data (gene or functional connectivity), indicating the importance of combining multi-modality data. Our neuroimaging prediction model built upon the first dataset was cross-validated by a completely new dataset of 98 subjects (r = 0.267, p = 0.0078) with an accuracy of 64.6%. In addition, the creativity–related functional connectivity network we identified in the first dataset was still significantly correlated with the creativity score in the new dataset (p<10−3). In summary, our research demonstrates that strong top-down control versus weak bottom-up processes underlie creativity, which is modulated by competition between the glutamate and GABA neurotransmitter systems. Our work provides the first insights into both the neural and the genetic bases of creativity.}

Cultural influences may lead individuals to weigh epistemic and deontic obligations differently; developing possibility conceptions are therefore positioned to be affected by cultural surroundings. Across two studies, 251 U.S. and Chinese 4-, 6-, and 8-year-olds sampled from major metropolitan areas in Texas and the Hubei, Sichuan, Gansu, and Guangdong Provinces judged the possibility of impossible, improbable, and ordinary events. Across cultures and ages, children judged ordinary events as possible and impossible events as impossible; cultural differences emerged in developing conceptions of improbable events. Whereas U.S. children became more likely to judge these events possible with age, Chinese children's judgments remained consistent with age: Chinese 4- to 8-year-olds judged these events to be possible ∼25% of the time. In Study 2, to test whether this difference was attributable to differential prioritization of epistemic versus deontic constraints, children also judged whether each event was an epistemic violation (i.e., required magic to happen) and a deontic violation (i.e., would result in someone getting in trouble). With age, epistemic judgments were increasingly predictive of possibility judgments for improbable events for U.S. children, and decreasingly so for Chinese children. Contrary to our predictions, deontic judgments were not predictive. We propose that cultural valuation of norms might shape children's developing intuitions about possibility. We discuss our findings in light of three accounts of possibility conceptions, suggesting ways to integrate cultural context into each.}

While much research exists about math discussions in classrooms, there is not much research on math discussions held online. Due to the important role of discussions in learning math, along with the growing trend of online classes, this study begins to take a look at how students make sense of and keep track of each other’s comments in an online discussion. In these online discussions, turn taking is not as intuitive as face-to-face interactions. Making sense of the discussion sequence and theme can also be challenging. In this study, I found that students used terms that represented mathematical operations to better explain their thought processes and also kept track of how their peers used these terms as well. These findings suggest that, for these students, when in an online discussion, the terms used were of importance when trying to make their thinking clear to their classmates. Also, in these groups, the mathematical terms were commonly used and re-used by more than one individual in trying to gain a consensus in their group thinking. These findings are important when thinking about how to best foster math discussion and learning in an online environment and for designing online classes that institutions use to supplement or support students.}

AES approximated or surpassed agreement and reliability measures achieved by the HR1 and HR2 with each other, and AES surpassed both human raters in efficiency. A list of answer keywords was created to increase the efficiency and reliability of AES. Low agreement between human raters may be explained by rater drift and fatigue, and shortcomings in the development of Item 1 may have reduced its overall agreement and reliability measures. It can be concluded that AES is a reliable and cost-effective means of scoring constructed-response nursing examinations, but further studies employing greater sample sizes are needed to establish this definitively.}

abstract = {Controllability, or the influence one has over their surroundings, is crucial for decision-making and mental health. Traditionally, controllability is operationalized in sensorimotor terms as one’s ability to exercise their actions to achieve an intended outcome (also termed “agency”). However, recent social neuroscience research suggests that humans also assess if and how they can exert influence over other people (i.e., their actions, outcomes, beliefs) to achieve desired outcomes ("social controllability”). In this review, we will synthesize empirical findings and neurocomputational frameworks related to social controllability. We first introduce the concepts of contextual and perceived controllability and their respective relevance for decision-making. Then, we outline neurocomputational frameworks that can be used to model social controllability, with a focus on behavioral economic paradigms and reinforcement learning approaches. Finally, we discuss the implications of social controllability for computational psychiatry research, using delusion and obsession-compulsion as examples. Taken together, we propose that social controllability could be a key area of investigation in future social neuroscience and computational psychiatry research.}

abstract = {This paper studies the information processing behavior of a decision maker (DM) who can only process a subset of all information he receives: before taking an action, the DM receives sequentially a number of signals and decides whether to process or ignore each of them as it is received. The model generates an information processing behavior consistent with that documented in the psychological literature: first, the DM chooses to process signals that are strong; second, his processing strategy exhibits confirmation bias if he has a strong prior belief; third, he tends to process signals that suggest favorable outcomes (wishful thinking). As an application I analyze how the Internet and the induced change in information availability affects the processing behavior of the DM. I show that providing more/better information to the DM could strengthen his confirming bias.}

abstract = {Currently, there is a burgeoning interest in digitalization as evidenced in extant literature. Nevertheless, the effect, based on teachers’ own perspectives, of the pedagogical use of digital technologies on learning outcomes in the higher education sector has been under-investigated. Thus, this paper aims to investigate the pre-conditions for the effective adoption of social media tools in the Nigerian higher education sector and to assess the impact of the adoption on specific learning outcomes. A multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methodology was proposed for study analysis, aided by views of experts with sufficient teaching experience in Nigerian business school programs. The results indicate that adequate budgetary allocations, technical competence, a sufficient level of privacy, and an effective government regulatory framework are the most important of the investigated pre-conditions. Additionally, the pedagogical use of social media in business school programs is more strongly associated with learning outcomes such as professionalism and strategic thinking, emotional intelligence, and social maturity. Hence, the article offers guidance to decision-makers in the higher education sector on how to actualize the successful adoption of social media for pedagogical use and build effective business strategies at various levels of the digitalization process.}

abstract = {The appearance of Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is significant for the future progress of the Internet of Things (IoT). Since the system model with a continuous action space and high-dimensional state space, the joint optimization of UAV trajectory and the computational offloading problem is non-convex, and traditional algorithms for instance ant colony algorithm, genetic algorithm, Actor Critic (AC) algorithm, and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm are difficult to cope with. Reasonably formulating the computational task offloading strategy and the trajectory control of the UAV is crucial for the high-efficiency completion of the task. In this paper, a computational offloading and trajectory control system model for UAV-assisted MEC is proposed. We seek to maximize the user ratio of coverage by jointly optimizing computing offload scheduling and UAV trajectories. We propose an improved DDPG algorithm to optimize the objective function and achieve the optimal solution. Meanwhile, our algorithm can achieve an improvement in the user rate of coverage while avoiding obstacles as compared with baseline algorithms, AC, and DDPG.}

There are many data-driven applications based on real-time monitoring and operational data in power units, while limited studies lay on the operational improvements, especially on coal consumption prediction under all working conditions. We build an intelligent prediction model of coal consumption based on key features selection, working condition clustering, and regression analysis. We combine feature construction and feature selection methods to cope with the problem caused by directly specifying feature subset for model building of traditional prediction method, which may fall into the thinking pattern and miss potentially better feature subset. Besides, to cope with the different coal consumption under different working conditions, we apply cluster analysis to construct a sub-coal consumption prediction model for each cluster category. Numerical results show that compared with other methods, it has the advantages of lower regression error and moderate model complexity, which can provide efficient decision support for operational improvement in thermal power generation.}

abstract = {When we are unaware of the causes for the observed deviations, we are more likely to react. When we react or are unaware of problems, we fail. Increasing the effectiveness of quality control samples starts with addressing what we do not know about them. So, this chapter first clarifies what we want, then describes what we have, and lastly what can be done to fill the gaps. The development, validation, and application of the batch control spike is a great illustration highlighting the importance the quality of the performance feedback and learning capacity the control samples are supposed to provide. When done correctly—while contextually questioning the relevance and appropriateness of current operating criteria, imposed limits and standards—the introduction of the batch control spike allows a process of critical errors identification, compensation, and progressive elimination to take place so that at the end, no significant systematic errors remain. This fact is demonstrated using z-scores from multiple international round-robin studies. In the context of achieving accuracy, the batch control spike examines the relationships between the standards used, when they are spiked, how they are spiked, and their purpose, that is, it renders the technology-in-use (isotope dilution) transparent and keeps it honest. It is also an excellent teaching tool. It is a quality learning sample helping the transformation of our methods into “thinking tools.”}

In this context, the present study analyzes the modeling strategies of one of the most common TES systems: stratified thermal storage tanks. These systems are essential to many solar thermal installations and heat pumps, among other clean energy technologies. Three different one-dimensional tank models are compared by their computing speed and resilience to long time steps. Two of the models analyzed are numerical, one being explicit and the other one implicit, and the other is analytical. The models are validated against data from experiments carried out considering small-scale stratified tanks, showing that their performance can be improved by using the Advanced Flowrate Distribution (AFD) method. The results show that the analytical model maintains its accuracy with longer time steps and is robust against divergence. Conversely, the numerical models show equivalent performance for short time steps, while the computation time is reduced. Although the AFD method shows promising results by achieving an improvement of 43% in terms of Dynamic Time Warping, its parameter optimization must be generalized for different tank designs, flow rates, and temperatures.}

abstract = {Increased battery energy density is required to boost electric vehicle endurance; however, this also raises the possibility of thermal runaway and power battery explosion. Improving the cooling system performance requires optimization and enhancement of classical systems. Traditional design approaches struggle to simultaneously enhance multiple aspects of performance, while an optimization based on Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) methods is often inefficient. Therefore, by integrating a flow resistance network model (FRNM) with a weighted average optimization algorithm (INFO), an efficient optimization for the comprehensive performance of the system can be achieved. Five optimized systems under different airflow rates were obtained through optimization. A comparison with two existing systems validated the effectiveness of the optimized system. The results demonstrate that, compared to the two reference systems, the optimized system decreases the maximum temperature difference by 65.51 % and 39.07 %, respectively. Furthermore, the improvement in temperature uniformity is more significant, increasing by 63.76 % and 34.40 %, respectively.}
