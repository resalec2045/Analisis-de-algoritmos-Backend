abstract = {Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics (STEAM) are fundamental basis for the development of our society. From this perspective, it is necessary to educate all people to solve problems underlying computer programming tasks since it is an important foundation of the STEAM world. Consequently, it is urgent to implement proposals aimed at the development of computational thinking, especially for girls since there is little representation of this group in the STEAM context. Therefore, this work is based on a systematic review protocol aimed at identifying the different strategies in the teaching and learning of computational thinking from a gender perspective, generating an alert regarding the needs of the female group in learning computational thinking and promoting gender-equitable education in this regard.},

abstract = {Even though the computer science education community has not definitively established exactly what ?Computational Thinking" entails, most will agree that it is using a computing machine to solve problems. Like all tools for solving problems, this knowledge should be made available to everyone. Jeannette Wing sounded this call in 2006, writing that "computational methods and models give us the courage to solve problems and design systems that no one of us would be capable of tackling alone." These skills are not just for computer scientists, but for anyone and everyone who plans to solve problems. We already teach other forms of problem solving to all our students including: Mathematical Thinking, Critical Thinking, and Scientific Reasoning. Computational Thinking, as well as engineering and design's Design Thinking, should be equally exposed to all students. It is also important to illuminate that these tools are not used in isolation to solve problems. Perhaps the key to the acceptance of Computational Thinking (as well as Design Thinking) as essential educational tools is to highlight their overlap and interdependence with other problem solving skills. The next generation will need practice with every tool at their disposal to be prepared to solve tomorrow's problems. I propose embedding Computational Thinking in a problem solving framework that leverages teachers' (and students') existing knowledge of problem solving in mathematics, science, and language arts in order to encourage teachers in non CS disciplines to teach Computational Thinking in their classrooms.},

abstract = {This experience report describes two iterations of a curriculum development process in which middle school teachers worked with our research team to collaboratively design and enact instructional units where students used sensors to investigate scientific phenomena. In this report, we examine the affordances of using a sensor platform to support the integration of disciplinary learning and computational thinking (CT) aligned with Next Generation Science Standards and the CT in STEM Taxonomy developed by Weintrop and colleagues. In the first unit, students investigated the conditions for mold growth within their school using a custom sensor system. After analyzing implementation experiences and student interest data, our team engaged in another round of co-design to develop a second instructional unit. This unit uses a different sensor system (the micro:bit) which supports additional CT in STEM practices due to its block-based programming interface and its real time data display. For the second unit we selected a different phenomenon: understanding and designing maglev trains.},

The first intervention involved evaluation of computational thinking through abilities of Generalization, Decomposition, Abstraction, Evaluation and Algorithmic Design, then students were offered 10 learning scenarios for Methodology of programming course. In the second intervention, 4 elements were manipulated to offer options in course of Programming, which were contents, modes of work, rhythms and time, and evaluation. In both interventions, use of Moodle platform allowed to expose learning contents and to have an appropriate context chosen by students. The main result was to generate personalized education as well as a learning experience that contributed to motivation of student in harmony with academic goals of initial programming courses.},

abstract = {As educational jurisdictions around the world begin to integrate computational thinking (CT) into their K-12 mandatory curriculum, there is a need to ensure that classroom activities are engaging, relate to student interests, and effectively promote the development of CT skills. The analysis of sports performance data fulfills this criteria for some students and teachers and presents an exciting context in which students from all K-12 grades can access complex CT concepts. This lightning talk investigates sports analytic tasks within the context of the CT in mathematics and science taxonomy introduced by Weintrop et al. (2015). Specific classroom activities are presented including analyzing the distribution of soccer goals, baseball salaries, the location of successful basketball shots, and the placement of volleyball serves. Examples of data analytics projects will be shared and the four main components of the taxonomy (data practices, modelling and simulation practices, computational problem-solving practices and systems thinking practices) will be identified within each project.},

After the 2016 challenge held in November in our country (Italy), we interviewed some participants on the difficulties they had faced and we modified some of the tasks accordingly. We then proposed the whole set of tasks, with some of them modified, to pupils who had not participated to the challenge in November and compared performances in the two sessions. Using Item Response Theory, we measured the change in the distribution of difficulty and discrimination of the modified tasks. On the basis of the obtained results, we tried to better understand the many factors which influenced the difference in performances, both in the conceptual and cognitive task content and in its presentation (text, images, layout).},

We show the primary education students' perceptions of the use of the software Lego Education WeDo in the subject of natural sciences to promote the computational thinking. We tried to test the following hypotheses: Students will learn to build and program 3D models with Lego Education WeDo (H1), students will think creatively to solve the problems (H2), Lego Education WeDo will help pupils to know the relationship between cause and effect (H3), and the tasks developed will allow pupils to reflect about the possibilities they have and to find the correct answer (H4). Based on the result analysis there were evidences of the effectiveness of the project to increase the participants' awareness of the computational thinking. The research also concluded that according to learners' perception, the way in which activities were designed provided them possibilities to learn to build models in 3D and program them. Moreover, the findings of the study also demonstrated that the success of the project also depended on the teacher's role as a guide in the teaching-learning process.},

abstract = {Our research group has studied how Kindergarteners through second graders can be introduced to the ideas of Computational Thinking (CT) through engineer design, unplugged, and programming activities. We often found it difficult to explain the boundaries and clear definitions for CT in research, to students and their teachers. Literature provides a variety of definitions from various perspectives, but these definitions often seem like capturing smoke. We see evidence CT, indicating fire, but how hot or lasting it burns cannot be measured by smoke alone. CT is typically defined by siloed concepts and skills. Some silos describe concrete ideas, which tend to be tied to programming principles. Many describe essential ideas, but over generalized becoming hard to teach and measure and distinguish from other types of problem solving. Is there a middle ground where we can clearly observe the presence and growing maturing of CT yet not limit the ways it can manifest, particularly without requiring coding? We hope this poster inspires conversation on 1.) the intersection of CT and programming skills, 2.) the priority and order for learning those skills, and 3.) how we can promote CT in disciplines who interact with and help define computational solutions yet are never expected to learn to program. We hope to share our perspective as well as garner feedback and possibly collaboration on better refining curriculum within Computer Science as well as promoting CT in other disciplines.},

abstract = {The recognition of middle grades as a critical juncture in CS education has led to the widespread development of CS curricula and integration efforts. The goal of many of these interventions is to develop a set of underlying abilities that has been termed computational thinking (CT). This goal presents a key challenge for assessing student learning: we must identify assessment items associated with an emergent understanding of key cognitive abilities underlying CT that avoid specialized knowledge of specific programming languages. In this work we explore the psychometric properties of assessment items appropriate for use with middle grades (US grades 6-8; ages 11-13) students. We also investigate whether these items measure a single ability dimension. Finally, we strive to recommend a "lean" set of items that can be completed in a single 50-minute class period and have high face validity. The paper makes the following contributions: 1) adds to the literature related to the emerging construct of CT, and its relationship to the existing CTt and Bebras instruments, and 2) offers a research-based CT assessment instrument for use by both researchers and educators in the field.},

abstract = {Using, processing and evaluating digitized information is relevant to every subject in primary and secondary school education. As this information is represented, modified and perceived through analog and digital media, competencies including critical reflection, knowledge, usage, and creation of information and media have been included in the German education system. Due to the highly inter- and transdisciplinary character of these skills, the development of a combined information and media literacy to teach the critical handling, reflection and design of information and (digital) media similar to a classical literacy concerning reading and writing skills. As this skill is fundamental for understanding the everyday digital environment, Computational Thinking poses a central idea of information and media literacy in order to understand how information of the real or fictional world are represented through digital media, how this digitized information is automaticly processed and displayed using media systems as well as how the resulting representations are interpreted. Information and media literacy adresses every subject and school type which is why it has to be integrated into future teacher education curricula. This paper shows the conception and implementation of an Information and Media Literacy certificate for student teachers with a focus on Computational Thinking. Based on recent studies, established curricula for Media Literacy, Computer Literacy and Digital Literacy as well as present Bavarian school curricula for Computer Science, we built the curriculum for the Computational Thinking part of the certificate upon fundamental ideas of Computer Science: Representation of Information, Software Engineering, Algorithms, Networks, Data Integrity and Data Security, Languages, and Physical Computing.},

However, there is still a lack of tools that assist learners and educators in the assessment of these skills. We have implemented an assessment tool, called Dr. Scratch, that analyzes Scratch projects with the aim to assess the level of development of several aspects of computational thinking. One of the issues to address in order to show its validity is to compare the (automatic) evaluations provided by the tool with the (manual) evaluations by (human) experts. In this paper we compare the assessments provided by Dr. Scratch with over 450 evaluations of Scratch projects given by 16 experts in computer science education. Our results show strong correlations between automatic and manual evaluations. As there is an ample debate among educators on the use of this type of tools, we discuss the implications and limitations, and provide recommendations for further research.},

In addition, research shows that the integration of CT in education has the potential to improve the problem-solving skills of K-12 students. This study aimed to investigate the effect of a CT experimental course on 94 primary school students' perceptions of their problem-solving skills as well as possible correlations between the variables concerning the students' perceptions. Participants worked in pairs in the context of Scratch, a block-based visual programming language, and the data were collected through the Problem-Solving Inventory for Children (PSIC). A one-group pretest-posttest was conducted and the results suggest that a CT course can improve participants' overall perceptions of their problem-solving skills. Finally, increases in the participants' levels of control over emotions and behavior when facing problems were correlated with increases in their will to face their problems rather than avoid them.},

abstract = {Work in culturally responsive pedagogy and culturally responsive computing (CRC)(Scott, et al., 2014) holds promise for how to include underrepresented students into making communities as they develop their computational thinking (CT) skills. Cultural responsiveness involves instructors using what they know about students' individual identities to develop learning opportunities; having high expectations; and understanding students' sociopolitical contexts (Ladson-Billings, 1995). By integrating these approaches, students encounter a makerspace without pre-determined cultural norms that encourages questioning assumptions that limit the development of inclusive technology. This poster explores preliminary results from a mixed methods multiple case study. Sixteen high school students participated in a two-week summer making program that focused on CT and physics skills. Students shared elements of their identities, brought in artifacts for "show and tell", collected data on how they spend their time, and categorized assets in their communities to then incorporate into their own projects. Researchers analyzed classroom observations, videos, interviews, and student notebooks, as well as students' pre-post tests and attitudinal surveys. Findings reflect the importance of valuing student identity, building community, and highlighting how CT and physics affect students' lives.

abstract = {Computational Thinking (CT) has been recognized as one of the fundamental skills that all graduates should acquire. For this reason, motivational concerns need to be addressed at an early age of a child, and reaching students who do not consider themselves candidates for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics disciplines is important as well if the broadest audience possible is to be engaged. This article describes a framework for teaching and assessing CT in the context of K-12 education. The framework is based on Agile software engineering methods, which rely on a set of principles and practices that can be mapped to the activities of CT. The article presents as well the results of an experiment applying this framework in two sixth-grade classes, with 42 participants in total. The results show that Agile software engineering methods are effective at teaching CT in middle schools, after the addition of some tasks to allow students to explore, project, and experience the potential product before using the software tools at hand. Moreover, according to the teachers’ feedback, the students reached all the educational objectives of the topics involved in the multidisciplinary activities. This result can be taken as an indicator that it is possible to use computing as a medium for teaching other subjects, besides computer science.},

abstract = {The paper describes the initial research on the integration of Computational Thinking, through the dissemination of skills and practice of exercises in a context of Gamification, within the framework of a pilot program called Apadrinamiento, aimed to students of high school who visit the facilities of the Universidad Tecnol\'{o}gica de Puebla, and that are considering studying in the Division of Information and Communication Technologies. The main objective is to increase the confidence of students in the solution of problems through the skills that exercise Computational Thinking. This report details the planning of the activities, the indicators to be measured and the scenarios where the interventions will be carried out that allow, in a second stage, the creation of strategies to avoid desertion. The main conclusion of the paper is to have created an academic strategy to benefit the understanding of pre-university students in the current computer world through the exercise of Computational Thinking.},

abstract = {The paper describes some selected approaches related to the support of teacher's work, which focuses on the development of computational thinking and the use of modern e-learning on-line resources. The article also deals with the design related to the research, which will be implemented in connection with these activities and will thus commit to the current professional discussion on the possibilities of development of computational thinking in connection with the Digital Education Strategy until 2020 and the upcoming reform of ICT curriculum in the Czech Republic. Web and mobile applications appear to be suitable e-learning resources for algorithm and programming studies that can contribute positively to the development of computational thinking. So far, however, no relevant research has described whether teachers or future teachers are familiar with these resources, whether they can use them, and whether they also meet their needs. We want to respond to all these facts in our research.},

abstract = {Teaching and training for high-performance computing in our college could not catch up with HPC research level. Thus, it is imperative to promote teaching reform on parallel computing course in our college. Our first parallel programming course is mainly for the first-grade graduate students majoring in CS and related branches with no previous HPC training. The goal is to teach them basic parallel programming methods, parallel thinking and parallel problem solving methodology by coding on a real supercomputer; let the students learn some representative parallel application development issues and some big challenges in HPC by project practice. In this article, we will present our course design objective, principles, practical method and outcome. Particularly, programming practice methodology, project organization, incentive mechanism and assessment methods in project practice will be illustrated. Finally, we present some quantitative findings. According to the feedback, our first parallel programming course achieves the effectiveness on inspiring students' enthusiasm for programming and improving students' abilities for problem solving.},
