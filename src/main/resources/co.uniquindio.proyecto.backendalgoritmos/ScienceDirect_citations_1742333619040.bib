abstract = {Food systems and our ability to secure food and nutrition for current and future generations is challenged by population growth, climate change, resource depletion and pollution. The current agricultural and supply chain systems are one of the main contributors to the issues. Transformational, not incremental change is needed to transition to sustainable food systems capable of feeding close to 10 billion people in less than 30 years. Artificial intelligence (AI) is pervading all parts of food systems in ways that indicate transformative system changes are possible. Designers, as mediators between people, technology and the environment have a responsibility to recognise and reflect on ways AI could bring the change needed to move to sustainable food systems. This literature review is situated at the intersection of Food systems, Design, Artificial Intelligence and Sustainability. The transdisciplinary approach reveals what exists across the disciplines, what can be done with AI to transition to sustainable food systems, how Design proposes to approach the change, and which ethical or philosophical considerations start to emerge. The discussion reflects on AI as a potential leverage point to bring changes in the system and on the designer's role in establishing the human-technology-environmental relationships. Further research and recommendations are provided.}

abstract = {The use of model membranes is currently part of the daily workflow for many biochemical and biophysical disciplines. These membranes are used to analyze the behavior of small substances, to simulate transport processes, to study the structure of macromolecules or for illustrative purposes. But, how can these membrane structures be generated? This mini review discusses a number of ways to obtain these structures. First, the problem will be formulated as the Membrane Packing Problem. It will be shown that the theoretical problem of placing proteins and lipids onto a membrane area differ significantly. Thus, two sub-problems will be defined and discussed. Then, different – partly historical – membrane modeling methods will be introduced. And finally, membrane modeling tools will be evaluated which are able to semi-automatically generate these model membranes and thus, drastically accelerate and simplify the membrane generation process. The mini review concludes with advice about which tool is appropriate for which application case.}

Despite all this work, tracing the core dynamics of metaphors over time remains a persistent challenge. To address this problem, I propose a systematic analysis of metaphor anchored around four core questions. What do metaphors describe? How do metaphors change over time? What do metaphors do? And how do conventional metaphors emerge? I address these questions in the context of one persistent and prolific metaphor: the network metaphor. To do so, I offer a formal model of the career of metaphor by drawing on cognitive linguistics and sociological theories of public ideas and professional careers. Specifically, I integrate the Google Books Ngram corpus with computational techniques that leverage co-occurrence to visualize and interpret the career of the network metaphor with respect to four areas: its jurisdiction, temporality, ecology, and conventionality. I leverage the network metaphor as both a revelatory case for evaluating my model and a critical case for deepening our historical understanding of the network. My analysis lends validation to the argument that the network metaphor has achieved the status of a broad category for thinking about contemporary life. However, it also demonstrates that the network metaphor had a lively history prior to the twentieth century. This includes significant changes in how it was used in the first half of the nineteenth century, a career standing in for anatomical structures of the body in the mid-nineteenth century, and a predominant expression in simile form prior to the start of the twentieth century.}

Effective shared decision-making between patients and physicians is crucial for enhancing health care quality and reducing medical errors. The literature shows that the absence of effective methods to facilitate shared decision-making can result in poor patient engagement and unfavorable decision outcomes.
Objective
In this paper, we propose a Collaborative Decision Description Language (CoDeL) to model shared decision-making between patients and physicians, offering a theoretical foundation for studying various shared decision scenarios.
Methods
CoDeL is based on an extension of the interaction protocol language of Lightweight Social Calculus. The language utilizes speech acts to represent the attitudes of shared decision-makers toward decision propositions, as well as their semantic relationships within dialogues. It supports interactive argumentation among decision makers by embedding clinical evidence into each segment of decision protocols. Furthermore, CoDeL enables personalized decision-making, allowing for the demonstration of characteristics such as persistence, critical thinking, and openness.
Results
The feasibility of the approach is demonstrated through a case study of shared decision-making in the disease domain of atrial fibrillation. Our experimental results show that integrating the proposed language with GPT can further enhance its capabilities in interactive decision-making, improving interpretability.
Conclusions
The proposed novel CoDeL can enhance doctor-patient shared decision-making in a rational, personalized, and interpretable manner.}

A new reality is that we are awash in data and tools to analyze these data and one of the most significant challenges is that of enabling the researcher to discover datasets relevant to their work, collect these data, assess its quality, and analyze it. The development of an adequate infrastructure within a researcher’s institution greatly facilitates progress on this front, both in terms of the development of tools and the development of local informatics expertise necessary to complement the domain-specific expertise of the researcher. As an informatics community we often ponder the heterogeneity of tools and resources on a global scale at the expense of the more immediate local problems encountered on a routine basis. Here, we suggest that getting our own houses in order by first employing interoperable solutions that support and facilitate collaboration amongst the complementary disciplines within our own institutions places the informatics community in a better position to address global informatics challenges. This approach can ensure that the solutions implemented employ an architecture and standards that support interoperability. Indeed, this is an organizational and cultural challenge rather than a technological one. Organizational structure and practices are described that provide a comprehensive base of talent capable of creating an environment that supports a sustainable informatics infrastructure, and that can quickly grow as needed to support the specific and rapidly evolving needs unique to that institution.}

Cognitive technology is currently simulated in safety–critical systems to highlight variables of interest, interface with intelligent technologies, and provide an environment that improves a system’s cognitive performance. In this study, the IDSM is being applied to an actual safety–critical system, an unmanned surface vehicle (USV) with embedded artificial intelligence (AI) software. The USV’s safety performance is being researched in a simulated and a real world nautical based environment. The objective is to build a dynamically changing model to evaluate a cognitive architecture’s ability to ensure safe performance of an intelligent safety–critical system. The IDSM does this by finding a set of key safety performance parameters that can be critiqued via safety measurements, mechanisms and methodologies. The uniqueness of this research will be on bounding the decision making associated with the cognitive architecture’s key safety parameters (KSP). Other real-time applications that could benefit from advancing the safety of cognitive technologies are unmanned platforms, transportation technologies, and service robotics. The results will provide cognitive science researchers a reference for safety engineering artificially intelligent safety–critical systems.}

We investigate the interplay between quantum and random dynamics by comparing the resources required, and examining numerically how the level of quantum correlations varies during the walk. We show numerically that the optimal non-unitary quantum walk proceeds such that the quantum correlations are nearly all removed at the point of the final measurement. This requires only O(logT) random bits for a quantum walk of T steps.}

Thus, this quantitative study aimed to bridge this gap by assessing the proficiency of Thai Gen Z accountants in detecting accounting fraud, with a particular emphasis on their digital, data science, and diagnostic skills. The study collected data from 150 participants using a structured survey questionnaire distributed to licensed accountants affiliated with the Thailand accounting program. It adopted a theoretical framework inspired by social learning theory and information processing theory to examine both direct and mediated relationships among the key variables under investigation. The results were analyzed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) to examine these relationships. The results showed that digital competency have significant direct effects on the fraud detection skills, with diagnostic skills playing a key role in the process. The study revealed that digital competency not only furnishes accountants with necessary technological expertise but also bolsters their analytical skills, which are vital for identifying fraudulent activities. Likewise, data science literacy—encompassing skills in predictive analytics, big data management, and data insight communication—significantly enhances accountants' capacity to identify and understand fraudulent patterns. The emergent role of diagnostic skills as a key intermediary emphasizes the importance of comprehensive training programs that foster both technical prowess and critical analytical thinking.}

This chapter discusses the characteristics of nonverbal thinking in man and elementary reasoning activity in animals and children. Verbal thinking is associated with the formation of a structural–functional organization of a pattern-code of verbal signals. Nonverbal thinking is associated with comprehension of the principles that make up the structural organization of environment. This type of thinking occurs in humans and other vertebrates. The chapter also discusses physiological and phenotypic aspects of nonverbal thinking. Both types of thinking have their own characteristics, which are related to the chemistry of the brain, and both reflect the nature of man. The main characteristic of nonverbal thinking is the success in performing the task at the first attempt. Repeated presentations of the task often lead to refusals to resolve it, the appearance of fear of the experimental conditions, and numerous signs of an overexcited state. A study described in the chapter revealed age to be a leading factor in determining the accurate understanding of object movement within the spatial–temporal coordinate system when the exact whereabouts of the object is unknown.}

For achieving our goal, items based on the PISA frameworks are developed, students in grades 5–8 from three different Russian regions are assessed, and three IRT models (unidimensional, multidimensional, and bifactor) are applied to process the data. In addition, the correlations from the multidimensional model are estimated to examine the degree of cognitive specificity and mixture modeling is implemented to investigate ability differentiation across grades. Statistical analysis reveals that the bifactor model comprising one general and six specific factors, has a better fit in each grade. Based on this model, we compute the variance explained by the general factor, with the estimates varying between 60% and 70%. In general, the pure variance explained by specific factors does not exceed 10%. The correlations are above 0.40 in each grade and the averaged associations tend to increase from 6th to 8th grade, although they are smaller in years 6 and 7 compared to year 5. The general ability differentiation effect is observed in grades 6 to 8 and is not present in grade 5. Specific ability differentiation is more pronounced in reading literacy, especially in grade 5 to 7. The results obtained are discussed from the perspective of the ability and developmental differentiation/dedifferentiation problem.}

The internal representation is distributed throughout the brain in two forms: (1) firmware embedded in synaptic connections and axon-dendrite circuitry, and (2) dynamic state-variables encoded in the firing rates of neurons in computational loops in the spinal cord, midbrain, subcortical nuclei, and arrays of cortical columns. It assumes that clusters and arrays of neurons are capable of computing logical predicates, smooth arithmetic functions, and matrix transformations over a space defined by large input vectors and arrays. Feedback from output to input of these neural computational units enable them to function as finite-state-automata (fsa), Markov decision processes (MDP), or delay lines in processing signals and generating strings and grammars. Thus, clusters of neurons are capable of parsing and generating language, decomposing tasks, generating plans, and executing scripts. In the cortex, neurons are arranged in arrays of cortical columns that interact in tight loops with their underlying subcortical nuclei. It is hypothesized that these circuits compute sophisticated mathematical and logical functions that maintain and use complex abstract data structures. It is proposed that cortical hypercolumns together with their underlying thalamic nuclei can be modeled as a cortical computational unit (CCU) consisting of a frame-like data structure (containing attributes and pointers) plus the computational processes and mechanisms required to maintain it and use it for perception cognition, and sensory-motor behavior. In sensory processing areas of the brain, CCU processes enable focus of attention, segmentation, grouping, and classification. Pointers stored in CCU frames define relationships that link pixels and signals to objects and events in situations and episodes. CCU frame pointers also link objects and events to class prototypes and overlay them with meaning and emotional values. In behavior generating areas of the brain, CCU processes make decisions, set goals and priorities, generate plans, and control behavior. In general, CCU pointers are used to define rules, grammars, procedures, plans, and behaviors. CCU pointers also define abstract data structures analogous to lists, frames, objects, classes, rules, plans, and semantic nets. It is suggested that it may be possible to reverse engineer the human brain at the CCU level of fidelity using next-generation massively parallel computer hardware and software.}

This article is about the neural conundrum behind the slowness of human behavior. The information throughput of a human being is about 10 bits/s. In comparison, our sensory systems gather data at ∼109 bits/s. The stark contrast between these numbers remains unexplained and touches on fundamental aspects of brain function: what neural substrate sets this speed limit on the pace of our existence? Why does the brain need billions of neurons to process 10 bits/s? Why can we only think about one thing at a time? The brain seems to operate in two distinct modes: the “outer” brain handles fast high-dimensional sensory and motor signals, whereas the “inner” brain processes the reduced few bits needed to control behavior. Plausible explanations exist for the large neuron numbers in the outer brain, but not for the inner brain, and we propose new research directions to remedy this.}

One of the major computational challenges that online businesses face today is to make sense of huge amount of information. Granular computing has emerged as an important conceptual and computational paradigm of information processing. As an emerging field of study, it has been suggested that granular computing at philosophical level concerns with structural thinking and at the application level concerns with structured problem solving. It has been further suggested that fuzzy information granulation, as a special case of granular computing, is likely to play an important role in the evolution of fuzzy logic and may eventually have a far-reaching impact on its applications. Responding to the calls for future studies dealing with the applications of fuzzy information granulation, this paper presents an application of the theory of fuzzy information granulation in an emerging and important area where there has not yet been any application, showing how online sports services can make sense of huge amount of data in a structured way and how they can structure their decisions. The empirical results show that despite the huge amount of data that needs to be processed, fuzzy information granulation can help online sports services make sense of it and identify meaningful granules for easier decision making.}

It has also been used to explore and implement computational type theory (CTT)—a formal theory of computation closely related to Martin-Löf's intuitionistic type theory (ITT) and to the calculus of inductive constructions (CIC) implemented in the Coq prover. This article focuses on the theory and practice underpinning our use of Nuprl for much of the last decade. We discuss innovative elements of type theory, including new type constructors such as unions and dependent intersections, our theory of classes, and our theory of event structures. We also discuss the innovative architecture of Nuprl as a distributed system and as a transactional database of formal mathematics using the notion of abstract object identifiers. The database has led to an independent project called the Formal Digital Library, FDL, now used as a repository for Nuprl results as well as selected results from HOL, MetaPRL, and PVS. We discuss Howe's set theoretic semantics that is used to relate such disparate theories and systems as those represented by these provers.}

abstract = {Mathematical modeling plays a crucial role in understanding and managing urban water systems (UWS), with mechanistic models often serving as the foundation for their design and operations. Despite the wide adoptions, mechanistic models are challenged by the complexity of dynamic processes and high computational demands. Data-driven models bring opportunities to capture system complexities and reduce computational cost, by leveraging the abundant data made available by recent advance in sensor technologies. However, the interpretability and data availability hinder their wider adoption. This paper advocates for a paradigm shift in the application of data-driven models within the context of UWS. Integrating existing mechanistic knowledge into data-driven modeling offers a unique solution that reduces data requirements and enhances model interpretability. The knowledge-informed approach balances model complexity with dataset size, enabling more efficient and interpretable modeling in UWS. Furthermore, the integration of mechanistic and data-driven models offers a more accurate representation of UWS dynamics, addressing lingering uncertainties and advancing modelling capabilities. This paper presents perspectives and conceptual framework on developing and implementing knowledge-informed data-driven modeling, highlighting their potential to improve UWS management in the digital era.}

Here we expand this assumption by showing that an extremely open-ended, high-level cognitive task of thinking about an abstract content, loosely defined as “abstract thinking” - leads to highly consistent activation maps. Specifically, we show that activation maps generated during such cognitive process were precisely located relative to borders of well-known networks such as internal speech, visual and motor imagery. The activation patterns allowed decoding the thought condition at >95%. Surprisingly, the activated networks remained the same regardless of changes in thought content. Finally, we found remarkably consistent activation maps across individuals engaged in abstract thinking. This activation bordered, but strictly avoided visual and motor networks. On the other hand, it overlapped with left lateralized language networks. Activation of the default mode network (DMN) during abstract thought was similar to DMN activation during rest. These observations were supported by a quantitative neuronal distance metric analysis. Our results reveal that despite its high level, and varied content nature - abstract thinking activates surprisingly precise and consistent networks in participants’ brains.}

We design an experiment to distinguish and test the relationship between two easily-confounded biases, optimism and overconfidence, both of which can contribute to wishful thinking. We find that optimism and overconfidence are positively correlated at the individual level and that both help to explain wishful thinking. These findings suggest that ignoring optimism results in an upwardly biased estimate of the role of overconfidence in explaining wishful thinking. To illustrate this point, we show that 30% of our observations are misclassified as under- or overconfident if optimism is omitted from the analysis. Our findings have potential implications for the design of information interventions since how agents incorporate information depends on whether the bias is ego-related.}

GA is also used when individuals with autism (ASD) and Williams syndrome (WS) are thinking during question-answer interactions. We investigated GA strategies during face-to-face social style interactions with familiar and unfamiliar interlocutors. Participants with WS and ASD used overall typical amounts/patterns of GA with all participants looking away most while thinking and remembering (in contrast to listening and speaking). However there were a couple of specific disorder related differences: participants with WS looked away less when thinking and interacting with unfamiliar interlocutors; in typical development and WS familiarity was associated with reduced gaze aversion, however no such difference was evident in ASD. Results inform typical/atypical social and cognitive phenotypes. We conclude that gaze aversion serves some common functions in typical and atypical development in terms of managing the cognitive and social load of interactions. There are some specific idiosyncracies associated with managing familiarity in ASD and WS with elevated sociability with unfamiliar others in WS and a lack of differentiation to interlocutor familiarity in ASD. Regardless of the familiarity of the interlocutor, GA is associated with thinking for typically developing as well as atypically developing groups. Social skills training must take this into account.}

Policy and public discourse around digitalisation embrace and adhere to the narrow tenets enlightenment thinking; the idea that rationality, individual freedom, and a society free from superstition are necessary and attainable goals. The costs of what has come to be called ‘Modernity’ are many. Through the application of rationality to all spheres of life, married with disruptive technological advancement, humanity has diminished its’ imagination – its ability to seek new directions. To paraphrase Horkheimer and Adorno, Modernism fights against nature, of which we are a part, and thus, paradoxically, sets us in a fight against ourselves. Environmental degradation, the price of progress, being just one example of this – deadening work, consumerism and severed social connections being amongst others. In this framing, digitalisation itself comes to be understood itself as akin to a force of nature – one that we can do little about, other than adjust and adapt or be swept away. But this by no means a foregone conclusion, there is light at the end of the optical fibre. Albeit that recent technical developments around artificial intelligence appears to be pushing policy makers into hasty decisions, the pace of the technical development is not as fast as we believe, and in comparison with the Reformation – we have time. If we can restrain ourselves from the resist, adapt or die responses promoted in popular discourse in face of the shock of large language models and rising threat of automation, then we create room to consider economic, social, and ecological alignment and accord, in the decision making and design of future interactive artefacts and digital services. The article argues that through postdigital aesthetics, technology makers can embrace materiality and the inherent qualities of digital technology to formulate a critique of existing trajectories in digital transformation, with consequences for a more sustainable future.}

The challenge is to develop parallel algorithms and computational strategies that can take full advantage of parallel machines. This paper reviews some of the characteristics of parallel computing and the techniques used to parallelize computational algorithms in CSD. The characteristics of parallel processor environments are discussed, including parallelization through the use of message passing and parallelizing compilers. Several applications of parallel processing in CSD are then developed: solutions of the Fokker–Planck equation, Monte Carlo simulation of dynamical systems, and random eigenvector problems. In these examples, parallel processing is seen to be a promising approach through which to resolve some of the computational issues pertinent to CSD.}

Central to this paper is a reformulation in terms of matrix arithmetic of the original ripple effect algorithm produced by Yau and Collofello in 1978. The main aim of the reformulation is to clarify the component parts of the algorithm making the calculation more explicit. The reformulated algorithm has been used to implement REST (Ripple Effect and Stability Tool) which produces ripple effect measures for C programs. This paper describes the reformulation of Yau and Collofello’s ripple effect algorithm focusing on the computation of matrix Zm which holds intramodule change propagation information. The reformulation of the ripple effect algorithm is validated using fifteen programs which have been grouped by type. Due to the approximation spurious 1s are contained within matrix Zm. It is discussed whether this has an impact on the accuracy of the reformulated algorithm. The conclusion of this research is that the approximated algorithm is valid and as such can replace Yau and Collofello’s original algorithm.}

Within the DIM paradigm, the input cognitive systems are not domain specific or core-knowledge specific, they are operational specific and capable of further developments that become domain specific while experiencing the environment. Arguments for this construal come from three sources: literature review, data collected through classroom observations, and a four-year experimental study of teaching and learning mathematics in primary grades. The outcomes of that experiment led to a methodology of learning based on activating the operational infrastructure of mind, which enhances students' flexibility of thinking and predicts the capacity to solve creatively a variety of problems.}

The veracity of such prospective action judgements, and the mechanisms by which they are computed, was explored in a series of tasks that involved either grasping (MC conditions) or thinking about grasping (PJ conditions) a dowel presented in various orientations. PJs concerning limits of comfortable hand supination and pronation when turning a dowel in the picture plane were highly consistent with values obtained during actual hand rotation (Exp. 1). The same was true for judgements regarding the level of awkwardness involved in adopting a prescribed grip (e.g. overhand with right hand) for dowels in various picture plane orientations (Exp. 2). When allowed to select the most natural grip (overhand versus underhand) or hand (left versus right) for engaging dowels in these orientations, subjects preferred virtually identical responses in both PJ and MC conditions. In both instances, they consistently chose the least awkward response options. As would be expected for actual movements, PJs involving awkward hand postures had longer response times (RTs), and were less accurate. Likewise, latencies for both grip and hand judgements tended to increase as a function of the angular distance between the current positions of subjects’ hands, and the orientation of the chosen posture. Together, these findings are consistent with a the hypothesis that PJs involve mentally simulated actions, or motor imagery. These results suggest that motor imagery does not depend on the existence of a completed premotor plan (Jeannerod, 1994), but may instead be involved in the planning process itself. A provisional model for the involvement of imagery in motor planning is outlined, as are a set of criteria for evaluating claims of the involvement of motor imagery in problem solving.}

abstract = {Background
Clinical trials demonstrate the efficacy and tolerability of medications targeting calcitonin gene–related peptide (CGRP) signaling for migraine prevention. However, these trials may not accurately reflect the real-world experiences of more diverse and heterogeneous patient populations, who often have higher disease burden and more comorbidities. Therefore, postmarketing safety surveillance is warranted. Regulatory organizations encourage marketing authorization holders to screen digital media for suspected adverse reactions, applying the same requirements as for spontaneous reports. Real-world data from social media platforms constitute a potential venue to capture diverse patient experiences and help detect treatment-related adverse events. However, while social media holds promise for this purpose, its use in pharmacovigilance is still in its early stages. Computational linguistics, which involves the automatic manipulation and quantitative analysis of oral or written language, offers a potential method for exploring this content.
Objective
This study aims to characterize adverse events related to monoclonal antibodies targeting CGRP signaling on Reddit, a large online social media forum, by using computational linguistics.
Methods
We examined differences in word frequencies from medication-related posts on the Reddit subforum r/Migraine over a 10-year period (2010-2020) using computational linguistics. The study had 2 phases: a validation phase and an application phase. In the validation phase, we compared posts about propranolol and topiramate, as well as posts about each medication against randomly selected posts, to identify known and expected adverse events. In the application phase, we analyzed posts discussing 2 monoclonal antibodies targeting CGRP signaling—erenumab and fremanezumab—to identify potential adverse events for these medications.
Results
From 22,467 Reddit r/Migraine posts, we extracted 402 (2%) propranolol posts, 1423 (6.33%) topiramate posts, 468 (2.08%) erenumab posts, and 73 (0.32%) fremanezumab posts. Comparing topiramate against propranolol identified several expected adverse events, for example, “appetite,” “weight,” “taste,” “foggy,” “forgetful,” and “dizziness.” Comparing erenumab against a random selection of terms identified “constipation” as a recurring keyword. Comparing erenumab against fremanezumab identified “constipation,” “depression,” “vomiting,” and “muscle” as keywords. No adverse events were identified for fremanezumab.
Conclusions
The validation phase of our study accurately identified common adverse events for oral migraine preventive medications. For example, typical adverse events such as “appetite” and “dizziness” were mentioned in posts about topiramate. When we applied this methodology to monoclonal antibodies targeting CGRP or its receptor—fremanezumab and erenumab, respectively—we found no definite adverse events for fremanezumab. However, notable flagged words for erenumab included “constipation,” “depression,” and “vomiting.” In conclusion, computational linguistics applied to social media may help identify potential adverse events for novel therapeutics. While social media data show promise for pharmacovigilance, further work is needed to improve its reliability and usability.}

This paper describes the development of a method that integrates input-output (IO) table flows with SD modelling to improve the completeness of UM assessments. This modelling framework can also allow for a ‘nested’ multi-region assessment which takes into account sustainability burdens consequent to urban system changes occurring elsewhere in the national and/or global economy. Pros and cons of this proposal are showcased by the illustration of a model for Lisbon.}

Utilizing system log data and two novel statistical methodologies, this study examined emergent patterns of controlled and regulated behaviors and assessed how variations in these patterns related to individual differences in prior literacy ability and target skill acquisition. Conditional probabilities and Entropy analyses were used to examine nuanced patterns manifested in students’ interaction choices within a computer-based learning environment. Forty high school students interacted with the game-based intelligent tutoring system iSTART-ME, for a total of 11 sessions (pretest, 8 training sessions, posttest, and a delayed retention test). Results revealed that high and low reading ability students differed in their patterns of interactions and the amount of control they exhibited within the game-based system. However, these differences converged overtime along with differences in students’ performance within iSTART-ME. The findings from this study indicate that individual differences in students’ prior reading ability relate to the emergence of controlled and regulated behaviors during learning tasks.}

Through this lens, we advance the argument that, at present, creative problem-solving remains a distinctly human capability. Specifically, we examine how artificial cognition can and cannot engage in each stage of creative problem-solving, as well as the underlying mechanisms of divergent and convergent thinking. Although we find little evidence to support the creativity of artificial cognition, we advance several ways in which artificial cognition can augment human cognition to enhance creative problem-solving.}

This Pandemic has forced many governments across the world to give momentum to OFD services and make their presence among the customers. The Presence of several multinational and national companies in this sector has enhanced the competition and companies are trying to adapt various marketing strategies and exploring the brand experience (BEX) dimension that helps in enhancing the brand equity (BE) of OFDPs. BEXs are critical for building brand loyalty (BL) and making companies profitable. Customers can experience different kinds of brand experiences through feeling, emotions, affection, behavior, and intellect. The present research work is taken up to analyze the factors affecting BEX and its impact on BL and BE of the OFDPs and analyze the mediating role of BL in the relationship between BEX and BE of the OFDPs in the Indian context. A survey of 457 Indian customers was carried out. A questionnaire was used for data collection and a mediation study was used to test hypothesized relationships. Our computational analysis reveals that BEX influences the BL and BE of OFDPs. The study further indicates that BL mediates the relationship between BEX and BE of OFDPs. The effective marketing and relationship management practices will help company to enhance BEX that will enable in enhancing BL and raising BE of their product. It therefore provides a more thorough analysis of BEX constructs and their consequences than previous research. Some of the managerial implication, limitations, and scope of future research are also presented in the study.}

This cross-case analysis study examined the supports that two students with disabilities, who were initially disengaged during computing activities, received during computing instruction. Data revealed that students' support needs during computing activities were not CT-specific. Rather, supports specific to these students' needs that were successful in other educational areas were also successful and sufficient in CT. Although additional studies would need to be conducted to ascertain the transferability of these findings to other contexts and students, our results contribute evidence that students with disabilities can and should participate in CT and be provided with the supports they need, just as in all other areas of the curriculum. We present a framework for evaluating student engagement to identify student-specific supports and, when needed, refine the emerging K-12 CT pedagogy to facilitate full participation of all students. We then offer a list of four implications for practice based on the findings.}

This chapter analyzes the four methods of capital allocation for operational risk by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision: (1) the basic indicator approach, (2) standard approach, (3) internal measurement approach, and (4) loss distribution approach. The chapter also explains why the internal measurement approach and loss distribution approach require leadership in databasing and datamining. The chapter depicts these four methods for computation of operational risk charges on a double scale: expected amount of capital allocation and complexity. Valid solutions take account of different perspectives and definitions of operational risk. The way operational risk is managed is affected by the manner in it is viewed, added with how the board and CEO come to grips with operational risk, the skills and tools at the regulators' disposal, and the resolve to put the risk under lock and key. This is the reason why Basel II wants banks to put aside capital for operational risk control.}

abstract = {Due to the widespread use of the internet, computer network systems may be exposed to different types of attacks. For this reason, the intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are often used to protect the network systems. Network traffic data (i.e., network packets) includes many features. However, most of them are irrelevant and can lead to a decrease in the runtime and/or the detection performance of the IDS. Although various data mining methods have been applied to improve the effectiveness of IDS, research regarding IDSs having high detection rates and better runtime performance (i.e., lower computational cost) is ongoing. On the other hand, the dimensionality reduction techniques help to eliminate unnecessary features and reduce the computation time of a classification algorithm. In the literature, the feature selection methods (i.e., filter and wrapper) have been widely used for the dimensionality reduction in IDSs. Although the wrapper feature selection techniques outperform the filters, they are time-consuming. Again, the ensemble classifiers can achieve higher detection rates for IDSs compared to the stand-alone classifiers, but they require more computation time to build the model. In order to improve the runtime performance and the detection rate of IDS, a swift wrapper feature selection and a speedy ensemble classifier are proposed in this study. For the dimensionality reduction, the swift wrapper feature selection (i.e., DBDE-QDA) is used, which consists of dichotomous binary differential evolution (DBDE) and quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA). For attack detection, the speedy ensemble classifier is used, which combines Holte's 1R, random tree, and reduced error pruning tree. In the experiments, the NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, and CICDDoS2019 datasets are used. According to the experimental results, the proposed IDS reaches 95%–97.4%, 82.7%, and 99.5%–99.9% detection rates for the NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, and CICDDoS2019 datasets. In this way, the proposed IDS competes with the state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection rate and false alarm rate. In addition, the proposed IDS has a lower computational cost than the state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, DBDE-QDA reduces the dimension by 60.97%–82.92%, 73.46%, and 96.55%–98.85% for the NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, and CICDoS2019 datasets.}

We review evidence supporting cognitive maps and image spaces, and we propose a hippocampal–parietal network that can account for the organization and retrieval of knowledge across multiple reference frames.

abstract = {Rationale and Objectives
Previous studies of aneurysm flow dynamics based on three-dimensional (3D) rotational angiography (RA) images were limited to aneurysms with a single route of blood inflow. However, aneurysms of the circle of Willis frequently involve locations with more than one source of inflow, such as aneurysms of the anterior communicating artery. The highest resolution images of cerebral vessels are from RA images, but this technique is limited to visualizing only one route of inflow at a time, leaving a significant limitation in the application of 3DRA image sets for clinical studies of patient-specific computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. In this report, subject-specific models of cerebral aneurysms with multiple avenues of flow are constructed from RA images by using a novel combination of image coregistration and surface merging techniques.
Materials and Methods
RA images are obtained by means of contrast injection in each vessel that provides inflow to the aneurysm. Anatomic models are constructed independently of each of these vascular trees and fused together into a single model. The model is used to construct a finite element grid for CFD simulations of hemodynamics.
Results
Three examples of patient-specific models are presented: an anterior communicating artery aneurysm, a basilar tip aneurysm, and a model of an entire circle of Willis with five coincident aneurysms. The method is evaluated with a numeric phantom of an aneurysm in the anterior communicating artery.
Conclusion
These examples show that this new technique can be used to create merged network numeric models for CFD modeling. Furthermore, intra-aneurysmal flow patterns are influenced strongly by merging of the two inflow streams. This effect decreases as distance from the merging streams increases.}

We describe a modified formulation of the Zuker-Stiegler algorithm with coaxial stacking, a stabilising interaction in which the ends of helices in multi-loops are stacked. In particular, optimal coaxial stacking is computed as part of the dynamic programming state, rather than in an inner loop. We introduce a new notion of sparsity, which we call replaceability. Replaceability is a more general condition and applicable in more places than the triangle inequality that is used by previous sparse folding methods. We also introduce non-monotonic candidate lists as an additional sparsification tool. Existing usages of the triangle inequality for sparsification can be thought of as an application of both replaceability and monotonicity together. The modified recurrences along with replaceability allows sparsification to be applied to coaxial stacking as well, which increases the speed of the algorithm. We implemented this algorithm in software we call memerna, which we show to have the fastest exact (non–heuristic) implementation of RNA folding under the complete Turner 2004 model with coaxial stacking, out of several popular RNA folding tools supporting coaxial stacking. We also introduce a new notation for secondary structure which includes coaxial stacking, terminal mismatches, and dangles (CTDs) information.

It is necessary to modify the operating point efficiently and accurately with the help of MPPT technology to maximize the collected power. Even though a lot of research has been carried out and impressive progress achieved for MPPT technology, it still faces some challenges and dilemmas. Firstly, the mathematical model established for PV cells is not precise enough. Second, the existing algorithms are often optimized for specific conditions and lack comprehensive adaptability to the actual operating environment. Besides, a single algorithm may not be able to give full play to its advantages. In the end, the selection criteria for choosing the suitable MPPT algorithm/converter combination to achieve better performance in a given scenario is very limited. Therefore, this paper systematically discusses the current research status and challenges faced by PV MPPT technology around the three aspects of MPPT models, algorithms, and hardware implementation. Through in-depth thinking and discussion, it also puts forward positive perspectives on future development, and five forward-looking solutions to improve the performance of PV systems MPPT are suggested.}

Here we take a neural model for rudimentary emotion generation and memorizing and use it as a guiding theory to understand decision making in an experimental oligopoly market. For the first time in that line of research, participants are put in a lab virtual social network serving to exchange opinions about deals with companies.

abstract = {Pair programming (PP) is a usefulness approach to fostering computational thinking (CT) for young students. However, there are many factors to impact the effectiveness of PP. Among all factors, the social factors are often ignored by researchers. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the impact of two social factors (gender and partnership) on PP in a primary school setting. To that end, we conducted PP experiments in four classes from the sixth grade in a Chinese primary school. The research results indicated: (a) there was no significant difference on compatibility among the gender pairs, but a significant difference among partnership pairs; (b) there was no significant difference on programming achievement and confidence among different pairs, and girls became more productive and confidence in PP; and (c) PP tightened up the partnership within pairs. These findings suggest that teachers should take partnership into account as an important factor in PP or other collaborative learning, and adopt PP as an effective approach to decrease the gender gap in programming courses, and make students socialize.}

The results showed a moderate-positive and small positive effect on students cognitive (Hedges' g = 0.681, 95 % CI [0.552, 0.810], p < 0.001) and non-cognitive (Hedges' g = 0.367, 95 % CI [0.113, 0.620], p = 0.003) levels, respectively. Based on the moderator analysis, there were differences in the learning outcomes among students across various task formats. Notably, tasks that included specific information and involved problem posing in context demonstrated significantly better performance. In conclusion, these results indicate the importance of problem posing instructional interventions in promoting student's development and their impact on cognitive and non-cognitive dimensions.}

abstract = {Background
As COVID-19 poses different levels of threat to people of different ages, health communication regarding prevention measures such as social distancing and isolation may be strengthened by understanding the unique experiences of various age groups.
Objective
The aim of this study was to examine how people of different ages (1) experienced the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and (2) their respective rates and reasons for compliance or noncompliance with social distancing and isolation health guidance.
Methods
We fielded a survey on social media early in the pandemic to examine the emotional impact of COVID-19 and individuals’ rates and reasons for noncompliance with public health guidance, using computational and content analytic methods of linguistic analysis.
Results
A total of 17,287 participants were surveyed. The majority (n=13,183, 76.3%) were from the United States. Younger (18-31 years), middle-aged (32-44 years and 45-64 years), and older (≥65 years) individuals significantly varied in how they described the impact of COVID-19 on their lives, including their emotional experience, self-focused attention, and topical concerns. Younger individuals were more emotionally negative and self-focused, while middle-aged people were other-focused and concerned with family. The oldest and most at-risk group was most concerned with health-related terms but were lower in anxiety (use of fewer anxiety-related terms) and higher in the use of emotionally positive terms than the other less at-risk age groups. While all groups discussed topics such as acquiring essential supplies, they differentially experienced the impact of school closures and limited social interactions. We also found relatively high rates of noncompliance with COVID-19 prevention measures, such as social distancing and self-isolation, with younger people being more likely to be noncompliant than older people (P<.001). Among the 43.1% (n=7456) of respondents who did not fully comply with health orders, people differed substantially in the reasons they gave for noncompliance. The most common reason for noncompliance was not being able to afford to miss work (n=4273, 57.3%). While work obligations proved challenging for participants across ages, younger people struggled more to find adequate space to self-isolate and manage their mental and physical health; middle-aged people had more concerns regarding childcare; and older people perceived themselves as being able to take sufficient precautions.
Conclusions
Analysis of natural language can provide insight into rapidly developing public health challenges like the COVID-19 pandemic, uncovering individual differences in emotional experiences and health-related behaviors. In this case, our analyses revealed significant differences between different age groups in feelings about and responses to public health orders aimed to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. To improve public compliance with health orders as the pandemic continues, health communication strategies could be made more effective by being tailored to these age-related differences.}

Neuroscientific studies typically find higher event-related synchronization in the EEG alpha rhythm for individuals engaged in creative ideation tasks compared to intelligence-related tasks. This study examined, whether these neurophysiological effects can also be found when both cognitive processing modes (convergent vs. divergent) are assessed by means of the same task employing a simple variation of instruction. A sample of 55 participants performed the alternate uses task as well as a more basic word association task while EEG was recorded. On a trial-by-trial basis, participants were either instructed to find a most common solution (convergent condition) or a most uncommon solution (divergent condition). The answers given in the divergent condition were in both tasks significantly more original than those in the convergent condition. Moreover, divergent processing was found to involve higher task-related EEG alpha power than convergent processing in both the alternate uses task and the word association task. EEG alpha synchronization can hence explicitly be associated with divergent cognitive processing rather than with general task characteristics of creative ideation tasks. Further results point to a differential involvement of frontal and parietal cortical areas by individuals of lower versus higher trait creativity.}

abstract = {Background
There has been an increase of autistic students without intellectual disabilities (autisticWoID) placed in general education settings (Hussar et al., 2020), but there is a lack of understanding of how to best support classroom learning for these children. Previous research has pointed to subgroups of autisticWoID children who display difficulty with mathematics and reading achievement (Chen et al., 2018; Estes et al., 2011; Jones et al., 2009; Wei et al., 2015). Research has primarily focused on symptomatology and communication factors related to learning in subgroups of autistic children. The current study sought to expand upon this research by assessing the validity of these previous studies and by investigating the specific contribution of domain-general cognitive abilities to differences in these subgroups.
Method
Seventy-eight autisticWoID individuals (M = 11.34 years, SD = 2.14) completed measures of mathematics and reading achievement, IQ, working memory, inferential thinking, and Theory of Mind (ToM). A hierarchical cluster analysis was performed on the math and reading measures.
Results
The analysis revealed two unique achievement groups: one group that performed lower than expected on math and reading achievement and a second group that performed higher than expected. Groups differed significantly on IQ and working memory and were distinguished by performance on reading fluency. Groups did not differ on ToM, inferential thinking, or symptomatology.
Conclusion
These findings describe a group of autisticWoID individuals that may be more likely to experience difficulty learning, which should be accounted for in general education settings.}

Widespread changes to climate-sensitive systems are placing increased demands on risk assessments as a foundation for managing risk. Recent attention to compounding and cascading risks, deep uncertainty, and “bottom-up” risk assessment frameworks have foregrounded the need to account for systemic complexity in risk assessment methodology. We describe the sources of systemic complexity and highlight the role of risk assessments as a formal sense-making device that enables learning and organizing knowledge of the dynamic interplay between the climate-sensitive system and its (climatological) environment. We highlight boundary judgments as a core concern of risk assessments, helping to create islands of analytical and cognitive tractability in a complex, uncertain, and ambiguous world. We then point to three key concepts—boundary critique, multi-methodology, and second-order learning—as critical elements of contemporary risk assessment practice, and we weave these into an overarching framework to better account for systemic complexity in the assessment of climate risk.}

The fusion of AI with applications such as machine learning, deep-learning, and even computational modeling allows for the real-time tracking and enhancement of biological processes within the body. An exemplary application of AI is the use of DeepMind's AlphaFold to design new GABA reuptake inhibitors for epilepsy and anxiety. Likewise, Benevolent AI and IBM Watson have fast-tracked drug repositioning for neurodegenerative conditions. Furthermore, we identified new serotonin reuptake inhibitors for depression through AI screening. In addition, the application of Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) settings using AI for patients with Parkinson's disease and for patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) using reinforcement learning-based transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) leads to better treatment. This review highlights other challenges including algorithm bias, ethical concerns, and limited clinical validation. Their proposal to incorporate AI with optogenetics, CRISPR, neuroprosthesis, and other advanced technologies fosters further exploration and refinement of precision neurotherapeutic approaches. By bridging computational neuroscience with clinical applications, AI has the potential to revolutionize neuropharmacology and improve patient-specific treatment strategies. We addressed critical challenges, such as algorithmic bias and ethical concerns, by proposing bias auditing, diverse datasets, explainable AI, and regulatory frameworks as practical solutions to ensure equitable and transparent AI applications in neurotransmitter modulation.}

In this paper a computational model of a human agent is presented which describes the effect of social support on mood. According to the literature, social support can either refer to the social resources that individuals perceive to be available or to the support that is actually provided in problematic situations. The proposed model distinguishes between both roles of social support. The role of social network characteristics has been taken into account, as an individual can perceive or receive social support through his/her social network. In addition, the number of connections (friends), strength of ties (relationships), social isolation and social integration have been studied. Simulation experiments have been done to analyze the effect of the different types of support in different scenarios and also to analyze the role of various social network characteristics on the mood level. It is shown that support can help to reduce the induced stress and thus can contribute to healthy mood regulation and prevention of depression. The presented model provides a basis for an intelligent support system for people with mood regulation problems that take the social network of people into account.}

It also reviews the range of critical indicators for CDWM performance assessment considered by the literature and put forwards a new framework for better assessing CDWM performance. The proposed framework summarises the system boundary, research scale and performance assessment aspects documented by previous studies, and further integrate an integrated framework with procedures for better assessing CDWM performance. The literature review found that while some studies adopt a system thinking and life cycle thinking to assess CDWM performance, other research they adopt a sustainability based model to finalize CDWM performance assessment. The results also demonstrate that compared with environmental and economic aspects, the social aspect has attracted less attention. Social factors, however are crucial in CDWM. The findings about current performance assessment practices in CDWM and the proposed procedures are possible to implement for researchers and practitioners to develop sound CDWM approaches.}

It is demonstrated that certain detailed features such as thread interaction do not need to be modelled to ensure useful results. Behaviour during the pre-loading phase of use agrees with previous long-standing studies. However, the pre-loading analysis does not carry over to the stage when external loading is applied, as is normally assumed and it is shown that the current, conventional analytical methods substantially over-predict the proportion of the external load carried by the bolt. The basic reason for this is shown to be related to the non-linear variation in contact conditions between the clamped members during the external loading stage.}

A multiscale probabilistic simulation-optimization framework is developed based on the nested nature of watersheds to inform decision robustness for Best Management Practices (BMPs). We presented a novel approach using hybrid Bayesian Networks (BNs) as interpretable and probabilistic emulators of process-based models. The hybrid BNs established at the scale of Hydrologic Response Units (HRUs) are embedded into simulation-optimization, whereby we analyze the cost-effectiveness-robustness of candidate BMP strategies at the subbasin scale. The optimal strategy is identified in compliance with water quality standards using watershed-scale integer programming. We apply the approaches in a typical intensively cultivated plateau watershed adjacent to Lake Dianchi, one of the three most eutrophic lakes in China. Our findings suggest that the hybrid BNs, incorporating both quantitative and qualitative information, are reliable emulators of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) in capturing critical pathways of diffuse phosphorus. Tradeoffs among cost, effectiveness, and robustness follow the law of diminishing marginal benefits. The optimum BMP strategies vary with policymakers’ preference toward robustness levels. Our findings indicate that robustness should be accounted for as an additional decision attribute besides costs and pollution mitigation. The benefits of the modeling framework are to (i) reduce over 99% computation complexity and support efficient decision-making under multifaceted uncertainties; (ii) improve interpretability and reliability of machine learning emulators; and (iii) inform policymakers of robustness with the probability of water quality restoration success.}

However, research investigating the use of simulations in early years' science learning is limited. This study applied revisions of Kolb's Experiential Learning theoretical model to determine if age-indicated science simulations were effective for teaching 5 year olds simple circuit building procedures and electricity concepts, and the function of circuit components. It also explored whether their engagement with the simulations provided worthwhile opportunities to exercise higher order capabilities such as reflective thinking and abstraction – skills oftencited in literature as valuable outcomes from older student and adult use of simulations. Findings indicate students developed a solid base of procedural knowledge about constructing different circuits, and functional knowledge about circuit components they applied to different circuit designs. The emergence of tentative, generalised theories about current and the effects of different circuit designs on the performance of resistors - linked to the exercise of reflective and descriptive thinking, were also noted in many students. However, examples were found of some simulations appearing to foster common misconceptions, such as current being ‘consumed’ by resistors – indicating teachers need to be highly vigilant and work closely with students, to ensure accurate understandings are developed. Overall, with appropriate teacher support and careful selection and review, the study concludes simulations can be effective for introducing young students to simple physical science concepts, and for providing them with opportunities to engage in higher order thinking processes.}

A new approach is proposed which employs attractive and repulsive particle swarm optimization (ARPSO) algorithm for ELD. Incorporation of ARPSO as a derivative-free optimization technique in solving ELD with security (voltages and line-flows) constraints significantly relieves the assumptions imposed on the optimized objective function. The proposed approach has been implemented on three representative systems, i.e. IEEE 14 bus, IEEE 30 bus and IEEE 57 bus systems, respectively. The feasibility of the proposed method is demonstrated and the results are compared with linear programming, quadratic programming and genetic algorithm, respectively. The premature convergence problem, that is common in all evolutionary computation techniques, is solved in ARPSO by including the diversity factor in the Type 1 PSO algorithm. The developed algorithms are computationally faster (in terms of the number of load flows carried out) than the other methods because only one run is required.}

The integration of educational games with immersive and AI technology provides great potential for transforming how individuals acquire and apply information sharing. This research determined the creation of significant educational applications that are personalized and adaptive through the use of image, emotional recognition and speech, intelligent agents that replicate the effects of an individual opponent and control over the complexities of game levels along with information. The study evaluated the different tools that educators and learners could utilize to develop immersive and artificial intelligence-based instructional games without a requirement for programming knowledge.

In this dichotomy we, i.e., the proponents of the network hypothesis, are inappropriately placed on the Lorenzian line. In particular, we argue that in contrast to Dhein's claim our concepts are not based on merely instinctive or peripheral modes of information processing. In general, on the one side our approaches have largely been motivated by the early biocybernetics way of thinking. On the other side they are deeply rooted in studies on the insect's behavioral ecology, i.e., in the ecological setting within which the navigational strategies have evolved and within which the animal now operates. Following such a bottom-up approach we are not “anti-cognitive map researchers” but argue that the results we have obtained in ants, and also the results of some decisive experiments in bees, can be explained and simulated without the need of invoking metric maps.}

In particular, they have claimed that CTT is in principle compatible with the existence of machines that compute functions above the “Turing limit,” and that empirical investigation is needed to determine the “exact membership” of the set of functions that are physically computable. I argue for the following points: (a) It is highly doubtful that philosophers and cognitive scientists have widely misunderstood CTT as alleged.1 In fact, by and large, computability theorists and mathematical logicians understand CTT in the exact same way. (b) That understanding most likely coincides with what Turing and Church had in mind. Even if it does not, an accurate exegesis of Turing and Church need not dictate how today's working scientists understand the thesis. (c) Even if we grant Copeland's reading of CTT, an orthodox stronger version of it which he rejects (Gandy's thesis) follows readily if we only accept a highly plausible necessary condition for what constitutes a deterministic digital computer. Finally, (d) regardless of whether we accept this condition, the prospects for a scientific theory of hypercomputation are exceedingly poor because physical science does not have the wherewithal to investigate computability or to discover its ultimate “limit.”}

An individual’s persistent feelings and activities, which include sleep disorders such as insomnia, sleeping overtime, or spending the majority of time lying down; pessimistic thinking about the future; and thoughts of committing suicide, help uncover the cause of depression. Several attempts have been made to prevent these losses and deaths. Our study proposes a simple fuzzy inference model that accurately predicts depression levels based on emotions and activities—even with incomplete data and uncertainties—and enhances mental health prediction, bridging theory and practice effectively. Psychologists and professors collaborated to create a survey to collect data for this study. The experiment was conducted using a Google survey form. This method effectively captures the ambiguity and imprecision in depression evaluation by combining linguistic elements of psychological traits. Using the Pearson correlation and R-squared methods, 15 features were chosen from 30 features, followed by five membership functions (poor, mediocre, average, decent, and good) and fuzzy rules to evaluate and create accurate forecasts of depression severity. Our proposed architecture can correctly classify depression levels based on human activities and feelings with 94% accuracy using a less sophisticated rules dictionary than previous pre-trained or hybrid models. Fuzzy logic performs better here by accurately categorizing ambiguous human emotional inputs into distinct degrees.}

This chapter discusses how different types of entities such as individual objects, sets of objects, and ensembles can function as items to be maintained in working memory (WM). All of these types of representations can be relevant to thinking about quantities, and each supports different kinds of quantity-relevant computations. One way to overcome the three- to four-item limit of WM is to bind together representations of individual objects into representations of sets of objects. Binding multiple individuals into a single higher-order group can increase the number of individual items that can be remembered, as in the well-known demonstrations of chunking by adults. Set representations play a critical role in many numerical processes, including representing the nested relationships between as well as representing the cardinality of an array. Many real-world scenes contain stimuli that do not lend themselves to representation qua individual objects or sets of objects. One can imagine enumerating a flock containing dozens of individual birds.}

The purpose of this study was to develop and validate a tool to assess changes in young learners' attitudes toward coding: the Elementary Student Coding Attitudes Survey (ESCAS). We validated the scale using Confirmatory Factory Analysis and Structural Equation Modeling with responses from over 6000 4th-6th grade students (aged 9–12 years). Survey validation revealed a scale consisting of five constructs that comprise young learners' attitudes toward coding: social value, coding confidence, coding interest, perception of coders, and coding utility. In our analysis, students' grade level, ethnicity, gender, coding frequency, coding experience, and math interest influenced social value, which in turn influenced coding interest, perception of coders, and coding utility. Students' math confidence, coding frequency, coding experience, ethnicity, and coding interest predicted their coding confidence. Among observable variables, coding frequency and math interest had the greatest influence on social value, which substantially influenced all other factors. We discuss how this tool can help those who teach coding to young children to better measure and understand the variables that may influence young learners’ attitudes toward coding over time.}

In recent years, however, there has been a shift toward focusing, not only on solving problems, but also on conceptual knowledge. In the current work, we reviewed (1) how conceptual knowledge is defined in the mathematical thinking literature, and (2) how conceptual knowledge is defined, operationalized, and measured in three mathematical domains: equivalence, cardinality, and inversion. We uncovered three general issues. First, few investigators provide explicit definitions of conceptual knowledge. Second, the definitions that are provided are often vague or poorly operationalized. Finally, the tasks used to measure conceptual knowledge do not always align with theoretical claims about mathematical understanding. Together, these three issues make it challenging to understand the development of conceptual knowledge, its relationship to procedural knowledge, and how it can best be taught to students. In light of these issues, we propose a general framework that divides conceptual knowledge into two facets: knowledge of general principles and knowledge of the principles underlying procedures.}

Pre- and post-assessments measured familiarity with technology, appeal of coding apps, knowledge of Daisy commands, ability to play Kodable, and conceptual understanding of coding. Participants improved in their knowledge of Daisy commands (i.e., move, grow, jump) and Kodable gameplay (i.e., placing arrows in the correct sequence to move a character through a maze), but did not improve in their ability to verbally explain what coding is. Appeal of the games was significantly related to children's learning of Daisy commands, but child gender was not related to either Daisy or Kodable learning outcomes. Results suggest that young children can learn foundational coding skills via apps, especially when the apps are appealing to children.}

abstract = {Although there is a deep historical relationship between hydrology and society, the relationship has considerably evolved in the last three decades. Hydrologists, in particular those involved in designing of decision-support tools, are experiencing a widening gap between an academic discipline which has progressively moved away from field-based applied natural science to computational hydrology, and the multiplication of stakeholders involved in the water-related issues addressed by research. The challenge for hydrology is now to negotiate this shift and to rethink its engagement in society. This paper provides a description of a planned process designed to improve hydrology-society interactions and to foster reflexivity in socio-hydrology. Based on an interdisciplinary reflexive process undertaken in Tunisia from 2016 to 2020, we identified three types of discomforts in the dialogue with society, inviting scientists to lucidly engage with these discomforts. We formulated four key reflexive propositions to achieve a better alignment of scientific stance, research practices and discourse. The first proposition concerns the need to explain more clearly the value systems scientists engage in and with society. The second concerns the need to position hydrology in society and not outside it, by reconsidering the functions that research fulfils in society. The third is an invitation to redefine the perimeter of the research interlocutors and the way to reach them. The fourth is to revisit scientific practices to build on the strengths of the dialogue between field-based natural science and computational hydrology. The paper concludes that adopting a reflexive posture towards these four dimensions of the dialogue between hydrology and society is an effective way to overcome discomforts and to refocus research stance, practices and discourse. It is a way to renew hydrology's place in society and to contribute to the current thinking in socio-hydrology initiated by hydrologists.}

Its dominant paradigms such as utility theory, prospect theory, and the modern dual-process theories all resort to formal algebraic models or non-mathematical postulates, and remain purely phenomenological. An approach introduced by Grossberg deployed differential equations describing neural networks and bridged the gap between decision science and the psychology of cognitive–emotional interactions. However, the limits within which neural models can explain data from real people’s actions are virtually untested and remain unknown. Here we show that a model built around a recurrent gated dipole can successfully forecast individual economic choices in a complex laboratory experiment. Unlike classical statistical and econometric techniques or machine learning algorithms, our method calibrates the equations for each individual separately, and carries out prediction person-by-person. It predicted very well the behaviour of 15%–20% of the participants in the experiment–half of them extremely well–and was overall useful for two thirds of all 211 subjects. The model succeeded with people who were guided by gut feelings and failed with those who had sophisticated strategies. One hypothesis is that this neural network is the biological substrate of the cognitive system for primitive–intuitive thinking, and so we believe that we have a model of how people choose economic options by a simple form of intuition. We anticipate our study to be useful for further studies of human intuitive thinking as well as for analyses of economic systems populated by heterogeneous agents.}

The low image decomposition performance and the unconvincing reconstruction of the approximation image are the two main limitations of the previous methods. In this paper, a new single sample face recognition method based on lower-upper (LU) decomposition algorithm is proposed. The procedure of the proposed method is as following. First, the single sample and its transpose are decomposed to two sets of basis images by using the LU decomposition algorithm, which is more efficient than the image decomposition algorithms of the previous works. Two approximation images are reconstructed from the two basis image sets by the reverse thinking approach based on experimental analysis. Then, the fisher linear discriminant analysis (FLDA) algorithm is used to evaluate the optimal projection space by using the new training set consisting of the single sample and its two approximation images for each person. Finally, the nearest neighbor classifier based on Euclidean distance is adopted as the final classification. We make two main contributions: one is that we propose to decompose the single sample and its transpose using the efficient LU decomposition algorithm, and reorder each basis image set according to the basis image energy; the other is that we present a reverse thinking approach based on experimental analysis to reconstruct the approximation image. The performance of the proposed method is verified using four public face databases, namely FERET, AR, ORL and Yale B. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method is efficient and outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches which are proposed to address the single sample per person problem.}

Our purpose, therefore, is to understand whether LIWC can be depended upon for large-scale analyses; we initially examine this here using a small sample of posts from a set of just eight users and manually checking the program's automated codings of a subset of categories. Our results show that the LIWC coding cannot be relied upon – precision falls to as low as 49.6 % and recall as low as 41.7 % for some categories. It would be possible to engage in considerable manual correction of these results, but this undermines its purported efficiency for large datasets.}

Although some progress toward understanding the molecular‐level details of fibril structure has been made through in vitro experiments, the insoluble nature of fibrils make them difficult to study experimentally. We describe two computational approaches used to investigate fibril formation and structure: intermediate‐resolution discontinuous molecular dynamics simulations and atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. Each method has its strengths and weaknesses, but taken together the two approaches provide a useful molecular‐level picture of fibril structure and formation.}

This two-part series aims to demonstrate the basic principles, methodology and specific examples of active learning with formative assessment implemented to achieve improved student academic performance. In this part I of the two-part series, firstly, a detailed description is introduced of the cognitive learning methodology which makes use of student-centered recognition, analysis and synthesis for decision-making when there is no entirely right or wrong decision. The concept of “decision situation” is described which combines several surrounding and contingency elements to arrive at a demonstration of the holistic decision-making through systems analysis. A Holistic thinking approach is further developed using a systems learning methodology that combines normative with descriptive analyses to arrive at a cognitive mode model of judgement and choice. Sustainability modelling using the three-gateway systems approach is introduced and compared with the multi-layered view of chemical and biochemical engineering education and research; see Gani et al. (2020). Holistic thinking strategy is applied most recently to integrating, backcasting and eco-design for the circular economy (CE); see Mendoza et al. (2017). A student-centred learning approach is advocated that makes use of these principles and enables the systematic embedding of sustainability modeling in industrial and economic activities whose success rely substantively on decision-making. Finally, the relative importance is evaluated using classroom data available with specific engineering topics of the didactic “rule-based” methods of knowledge transfer in contrast with the experiential accumulation of practical information amassed through social interactions in a co-operative learning environment that relies on sustained improvement through active communication and feedback between the teacher/instructor and the student/learner; see Stephan et al. (2017) and Shallcross and Alpay (2018).}

In this article, we are particularly interested in social creativity in communities of interest. Building on Guilford's classic model of Divergent Thinking of fluency, flexibility, originality and elaboration, we employ Social Network Analysis to model the creative design process. The creative process in the current study takes place in a technological environment called the ‘MC-squared platform’, in which members of a community of interest collaborate in a social, co-creative process for designing digital, mathematical textbooks. Both the technological environment and the methodology are exemplified through two case examples, one on the design process of a digital book about a bioclimatic amusement park and one on the design process of a digital book about fractions. We conclude that, for these examples, both the technological tool and the data analysis approach provide insight into the social creativity process of the community of interest.}

abstract = {Misophonia is a disorder in which specific common sounds such as another person breathing or chewing, or the ticking of a clock, cause an atypical negative emotional response. Affected individuals may experience anger, irritability, annoyance, disgust, and anxiety, as well as physiological autonomic responses, and may find everyday environments and contexts to be unbearable in which their ‘misophonic stimuli’ (often called ‘trigger sounds’) are present. Misophonia is gradually being recognized as a genuine problem that causes significant distress and has negative consequences for individuals and their families. It has only recently come under scientific scrutiny, as researchers and clinicians are establishing its prevalence, distinguishing it from other disorders of sensory sensitivity such as hyperacusis, establishing its neurobiological bases, and evaluating the effectiveness of potential treatments. While ideas abound as to the mechanisms involved in misophonia, few have coalesced into models. The aim of the present work is to summarize and extend recent thinking on the mechanistic basis of misophonia, with a focus on moving towards neurologically-informed cognitive models that can (a) account for extant findings, and (b) generate testable predictions. We hope this work will facilitate future refinements in our understanding of misophonia, and ultimately inform treatments.}

Many digital health initiatives have been developed and employed. However, barriers to their large-scale implementation have remained. This paper focuses on these barriers and presents solutions as proposed by the Dutch CARRIER (ie, Coronary ARtery disease: Risk estimations and Interventions for prevention and EaRly detection) consortium. We will focus in 4 sections on the following: (1) the development process of an eHealth solution that will include design thinking and cocreation with relevant stakeholders; (2) the modeling approach for two clinical prediction models (CPMs) to identify people at risk of developing ASCVD and to guide interventions; (3) description of a federated data infrastructure to train the CPMs and to provide the eHealth solution with relevant data; and (4) discussion of an ethical and legal framework for responsible data handling in health care. The Dutch CARRIER consortium consists of a collaboration between experts in the fields of eHealth development, ASCVD, public health, big data, as well as ethics and law. The consortium focuses on reducing the burden of ASCVD. We believe the future of health care is data driven and supported by digital health. Therefore, we hope that our research will not only facilitate CARRIER consortium but may also facilitate other future health care initiatives.}

Novel computational methods such as artificial neural networks, adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems and genetic programming are used in this chapter for the modeling of the nonlinear behavior of composite laminates subjected to constant amplitude loading. The examined computational methods are stochastic nonlinear regression tools, and can therefore be used to model the fatigue behavior of any material, provided that sufficient data are available for training. They are material-independent methods that simply follow the trend of the available data, in each case giving the best estimate of their behavior. Application on a wide range of experimental data gathered after fatigue testing glass/epoxy and glass/polyester laminates proved that their modeling ability compares favorably with, and is to some extent superior to, other modeling techniques.}

This paper examines the implementation of the DBS concept as a new teaching model to improve the problem-solving skills (PSS) of first-year students in engineering education. It also discusses the effectson learning experiences and pedagogical outcomes in both quantitative and qualitative terms. The research’s results identify the significance of applying this model as a real-simulated method-based learning experience. It can help students to improve their learning experiences and to enhance students self-confidence regarding PSS.}

FEA has been used in bone research for more than 30years and has had a substantial impact on our understanding of the complex behavior of bone. Bone is structured in a hierarchical way covering many length scales and this chapter reflects this hierarchical organization. In particular, the focus is on the applications of FEA for understanding the relationship between bone structure and its mechanical function at specific hierarchical levels. Depending on the hierarchical level, different issues have been investigated with FEA ranging from more clinically oriented topics related to bone quality (e.g., predicting bone strength and fracture risk) to more fundamental problems dealing with the mechanical aspects of biological processes (e.g., stress and strain around osteocyte lacunae) as well as with the micromechanical behavior of bone at its ultrastructure. A better understanding of the relationship between structure and mechanical function is expected to be important for the current trends in (bio)materials design, where the structure of biological materials is considered as a possible source of inspiration, as well as for more successful approaches in the prevention and treatment of age- and disease-related fractures.}
